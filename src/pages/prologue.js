              The latest sighting of the dragon terrorising Australis has been
              rumoured to be in West Australis. Adventurers from across the land
              have gathered to slay the beast, inspired by the grand reward
              offered by the king of Australis, Molcam Teranbul.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Thorin, the dwarven priest of Moradin and lorekeeper in his
              ancestral dwarven home, waits anxiously at a rather ordinary
              tavern in O’Pertha. He takes a long swig of ale while seated in
              “The Elegant Mug”, but the name isn’t very fitting considering the
              place was considerably run down and definitely a shadow of its
              former self. He has limited knowledge of the surface world but he
              knew that greed was the same everywhere- adventurers would
              definitely show up one way or another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before long, a group of adventurers show up and take a seat at the
              table where Thorin is sitting. He continues to drink from his mug
              and fixes his eyes on the people who have just entered the tavern.
              One of the adventurers is a dragonborn, an extremely rare species
              in Australis considering their draconic heritage and bloodline.
              His horns and scaly skin don’t leave much to the imagination in
              terms of appearance, and the blue hue of his skin emits a faint
              glow against the tavern lighting.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Another is a small corpulent goblin donning knight’s armour, who
              has a greatspear attached to his back. He has an air of arrogance
              and gives off incredible impulsiveness that Thorin cannot stand.
              His movements are twitchy, sporadic, uncontrolled.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>He seems like a troublesome one, Thorin thinks to himself.</p>
            <p>
              The final adventurer is a kobold and his demeanour greatly
              contrasts its goblin companion. He seemed reserved and timid, as
              expected of a member of that race. However, Thorin could sense a
              deadly and merciless precision in this kobold and notices the
              glint of metal from a stiletto dagger concealed in the kobold’s
              trousers.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>“Who are ye?” Thorin asks as he puts down his mug.</p>
            <p>
              “Oh me? I’m just off to explore the world and assert my dominance
              mate,” the dragonborn replies, “but you can call me Dig Bickman”.
              The goblin announces, “Sir Styx, at your service! Mighty barbarian
              and an even better lover!” The kobold joins in, “I am Robin
              Banks... sir.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Thorin orders a round for the group of adventurers and asks them
              their motivations for hunting down this dragon.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>“I want to test my strength.” Dig says.</p>
            <p>“Gold, and a fucking lot of it!” Styx says.</p>
            <p>
              Robin shrugs, it seems that he follows the goblin around a lot and
              doesn’t have much of a mind of his own.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thorin smiles, “well my friends, then I suppose we go and find out
              about this dragon then. It’s going to be a pleasure working
              together.”
            </p>
            <p>He would later come to regret this.</p>
            <p>
              The party move around the tavern and eventually ask the owner what
              he knows about the dragon (after Dig gets funky with the local
              townswomen). After much coercion the tavern owner eventually
              reveals that he knew things about a black dragon which was sighted
              in West Australis but that cultists had taken his daughter captive
              upstairs. Until the party secured the safety of his daughter, his
              lips were sealed. The party would have protested but the presence
              of the village guards more or less forced their hands- they go
              upstairs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upstairs they are met by two elven wenches. Although Thorin, Sir
              Styx and Robin are unaffected by their charms, the raging draconic
              blood coursing through Dig’s veins does not allow him to resist
              the advances of the two beauties. He is led by the hand into
              another room and is not heard from for a while. Meanwhile, the
              rest of the party investigates around the upper floor and before
              long, come across the group of cultists responsible for the
              capture of the owner’s daughter. After dispatching of the first
              group, the party retrieve Dig from the elven wenches (who turned
              out to be part of the cult) and don the uniform of the cultists.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Dig attempts to infiltrate the cult but due to a lack of human
              courtesy and understanding, instead provokes the cultists into a
              battle. Fortunately, the rest of the party were already in
              position to spring a trap and they make quick work of the
              cultists, slicing and dicing through them like nothing at all.
              They retrieve the daughter, who is strapped to a bed and fully
              naked with several slashing wounds over her body. The party
              stabilize her and return her to the owner, who appreciatively
              informs the party that the black dragon they are searching for was
              last seen perched at Mount Medadee located in the Unpleasant
              Mountain Range.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              The party set off on Cronana Freeway towards the village at the
              mountain base and along the way come across a trade cart of sorts.
              There is a lone man responsible for the trade cart named James,
              and he asks for the party’s help in escorting him to the mountain
              base. The entire party agrees but Sir Styx decides to threaten the
              trader and assert his dominance. Thorin is not impressed but comes
              to expect no less from a bloody goblin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Speaking of goblins, the party is stopped by a blockade set up by
              a band of goblins. It is very crude and not expertly done but it
              definitely does the job, because after failed diplomacy with the
              goblin bandits they are ambushed. Robin is an expert killer and
              professional rogue of the Weaboo clan and decides that the best
              course of action is to take cover behind a rock.
            </p>
            <p>
              He is dispatched instantly by one of the goblins. Sir Styx is
              enraged by his comrade being knocked out and swings his greatspear
              wildly as he rampages through the ranks of the goblins. Despite
              being of the same race, he feels no remorse as he cuts down six of
              the goblins single-handedly. Dig throws in a couple of fire bolts
              to take care of the remaining goblin archers and Thorin gets busy
              healing the party as a priest of Moradin.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, killing the goblins was not enough. Sir Styx decides to
              knock one of the goblins unconscious and sets up a ring using the
              spears of the fallen goblins. He then forces James the merchant
              who they are supposed to protect into a fighting ring to the death
              with the remaining goblin. Miraculously, James proves victorious
              over the goblin but swears that Sir Styx will get what’s coming to
              him one day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The party set up camp and recuperate themselves. They are happily
              chatting away and enjoying their down time but Sir Styx notices
              that James is slowly creeping up from behind him with a concealed
              knife. The goblin barbarian preemptively strikes James and
              instantly kills him. The party is forced to burn the body to
              remove all evidence and they decide that they should continue
              transporting the cart to its final destination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually they reach the mountain base and are taken aback by the
              sights. They are so close to the mountain that they are filled
              with adrenaline at the prospect of killing a dragon. Or at least
              they would be, but instead they are assaulted by thugs who
              happened to be the friends of James. The party attempt to parley
              with the thugs but due to the incessant taunts from Sir Styx and
              the idiotic ramblings of Dig (who insisted James was killed by
              Syphilis), end up in an unforgettable battle with the fighters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Underleveled and undermanned, one of the members is about to be
              killed but a booming voice echoes from one of the buildings in the
              mountain base village. An imposing dwarf steps out, holding a
              hammer and rocking some mechanically advanced gear. He demands the
              thugs to stop attacking and welcome the party into his Wonder
              Factory. It turns out that he is the one who was awaiting the
              supplies that were in the cart being transported by the party. He
              thanks the party by awarding them one boomstick, his latest
              invention. In all regards it is a simple firearm but packs a
              wallop, something that the party will need to take down something
              as fierce as a dragon. After much discussion, it is decided that
              the dwarven smith, named Grundle Fireshaper, would accompany the
              party upon their return from the mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Off into the mountain they went and they once again faced another
              dilemma: three paths on the mountain each with a different
              challenge. The left path took them to a swarm of harpies preying
              on an innocent girl, the middle path was a bridge with chilling
              razorwinds capable of ripping a man to shreds, and the right path
              leading straight to a sleeping stone giant. The party decide to
              save the mysterious woman from the harpies (after another failed
              diplomacy situation), who helps them convince the stone giant to
              give them cover over the treacherous bridge.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite almost falling off several times and many heart stopping
              constitution saves, the party manages to traverse the bridge
              without any casualties. They finally reach the mountain lair where
              the dragon is said to reside but the giant and the woman say they
              could continue any further and leave. Once the party is inside
              they are overcome with fear as blood stains, gargled screams and
              poisonous mists fill the air.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              They discover several statues resembling demons and Thorin
              recognizes one of them as belonging to another plane called Earth.
              As they continue forth they discover a Djinn who is tasked to
              guarding the entrance to the fountain of youth. He deems Sir Styx
              to be worthy, who goes into the path and chances upon the
              fountain. He takes a drink and immediately feels revitalized and
              renewed. Meanwhile, the rest of the party answer the riddles of
              the Djinn who is thoroughly impressed with the mortals’ ability at
              wordplay. Apparently the Djinn’s manual of riddles was easily
              countered with the magic known as Google. Even so, he rewards the
              party with a mysterious amulet, which Sir Styx puts on. The amulet
              curses Sir Styx.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next problem is crossing a huge gap in the floor, there is a
              plank which the party can attempt to tip toe over but it is
              extremely difficult. Sir Styx decides that such a challenge was
              petty and easily overcome and therefore goes first. He stumbles
              and falls face first into the rushing waters below. The party
              reluctantly decide to jump in after and save him. What they come
              across is Sir Styx on top of a sacrificial altar, he appears to be
              completely paralyzed and unable to speak. Being a highly cunning
              rogue and perceptive individual, Robin notices that something
              isn’t right and warns the party of impending danger. Sure enough,
              four troglodytes appear out of the shadows to assault the party.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Dig wants nothing to do with this and takes a deep breath before
              exhaling a mighty jet blue stream of electricity from his mouth
              towards the foes. They are devastated and heavily weakened as they
              struggle forward to the rest of the party. A few more strikes from
              Thorin’s warhammer and a few stabs from Robin’s stiletto dagger
              make short work of the remaining troglodytes. They restore the
              reckless goblin and they climb back up to travel across the chasm.
            </p>
            <p>
              They get to the next room and what they see unnerves them. A group
              of cultists are chanting words in a language unknown to them and
              as the chant gets more intense, one by one the cultists start
              disappearing in a purplish haze. The last cultist seems to back
              out and runs away, sobbing. He collapses on the ground and makes
              apologies to the dark lord, but before the party can interrogate
              him Sir Styx throws his greatspear across the room and impales the
              cultist. Now with no idea what to do, the party continue forward
              until they come across a strange purple rift.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately, when Sir Styx drank from the fountain of youth, a
              small amount of elder knowledge was passed onto him. He identifies
              the purple rift as a portal to another plane and one that required
              the blood of a servant loyal to the creature of that plane.
              Therefore, he goes to the cultist that was freshly speared and
              smears the entire party with its blood... the party step into the
              portal.
            </p>
            <p>
              And they enter a hellish realm with ghoulish creatures and shadows
              flying in a swarm around them. The portal closes shut behind them
              and before their very eyes is a mighty beast with huge black wings
              and an other-worldly presence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The creature toys around with the party, giving them the illusion
              of choice. But he reveals himself to be Satan.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is no more choice. Sir Styx tries to give him lip. He is
              killed. Dig tries to conjure magic, it fizzles. He is killed.
              Robin attempts to run, fleeing from his dragon overlord. He is
              killed. Thorin prays to his god and charges into battle. He is
              killed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The great demon is siphoning the souls and very life force from
              the party and there does not seem to be much hope for them.
              However, as their vision slowly darkens and the world starts
              turning to eternal blackness, they see a glimpse of the woman they
              had saved from the harpies previously rushing in towards Satan.
              They see one more burst of intense light, and then all goes black.
