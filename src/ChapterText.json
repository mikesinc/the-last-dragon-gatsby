                    "Text": ["Robin, Sir Styx and Dig Bickman all wake up to the sound of a head being lopped off and screams. They have no idea how long it’s been or where they were. Robin hears approaching footsteps towards his cell. He hears the door to his cell door being unlocked and before long, a big burly guard steps inside to face him.",
                    "“Ah... he’s finally awake. I’m supposed to show you the Jarl,” The guard starts licking his lips and unfastens his belt, “but I suppose there’s time. I’ve never had kobold before.”",
                    "The kobold looks around for any weapons or tools that he could use but in the cell there is only himself and the advancing guard. Robin starts begging for forgiveness, tears streaming down his eyes.",
                    "“Please... I’m a virgin.” Robin collapses to the floor onto his knees.",
                    "Before the deed can be done a commanding voice echoes throughout the prison, “Stop what you are doing at once!”",
                    "The guard freezes in fear as he struggles to pull his trousers back up. It seems that someone, probably his superior, has caught them in the act. After threatening to have the guard sent to the executioners block, the guard directs Robin to follow him. The guard goes by each cell and gets to Sir Styx’s cell, but fails to spot him as the goblin is hiding sneakily in the corner of the room. Dig reluctantly steps out and follows the guard, who promptly doubles back to Sir Styx and eventually forces him out.",
                    "The three are brought before the Jarl and Countess of Burswood Court. It appears that they were captured and taken to New Pertha after their struggle with Lucifer on Mount Medadee. However, the Jarl is unimpressed and explains to them the plague that has been ravaging West Australis ever since the encounter. He places all the blame on the three and threatens to have them executed. Sir Styx repetitively disrespects the entire court by waving his schlong around and tensing his muscular goblin body, all while Dig desperately attempts to defuse the tense situation. As the situation turns dire and they are about to have their heads removed from their body, a blinding golden light bursts out and out of nowhere... the mysterious woman appears.",
                    "The mysterious woman reveals herself to be the last remaining angel on the realm of Earth, named Cassiel. Although severely weakened by the loss of her god after Lucifer’s destruction, she does what she can in Australis. She suspects that Lucifer also wishes to destroy the deities and eventually take over this plane, but she is unsure of the specifics of his plans. She surmises that the plague in West Australis is connected with Lucifer and says that only these heroes (Robin, Sir Styx, Dig Bickman) could have a chance in facing the dark demon.",
                    "The Jarl reluctantly agrees and sends the party on a mission to solve this crisis in West Australis. The three follow Cassiel who senses people who could be helpful on the journey. They are introduced to the court jester, Hugh Myrin, a human bard who is originally from Gymnasia. Hugh tries to woo the angel but gets absolutely shot down and his ego completely shredded. Sir Styx joins in the flirting but is also promptly rejected, though this doesn’t stop him from attempting to look up Cassiel’s skirt. The party are finally taken to another cell where a dark, mysterious, wizard is holed up. The wizard reveals himself as Tim of Felbourne and it seems that he has a dark secret, but it seems he is uncomfortable sharing it with the party for now. Cassiel reveals two sources where the party could investigate: Wind Thorp Fort where a priestess appears to be attempting communion with her god, and Kamalunda, a village towards the west coast of West Australis.",
                    "Before they are able to leave, the countess Eleesa Ann, shows them to her daughter who is currently also down with the mysterious sickness. Tim senses that the sickness is emanating a very dangerous aura and makes the entire party back out of the room. He also dispels the illusory magic of the countess who turns out to be disguising herself as a human; she is in fact an elf who is spying on the Jarl’s activities. Her true motive is to infiltrate the plans of the Liberator Party currently in charge of Australis and back up the agenda of the elves, who support the Labourer party.",
                    "~~~",
                    "Grundle Flameshaper, master blacksmith and extremely awesome dwarf extraordinaire greet the party with a gift of weapons, mounts, armor and more! After a brief amount of shopping in the city of New Pertha, which is now crammed with refugees and the sounds of the sick and dying, the party set off towards Wind Thorp Fort.",
                    "Along Cronana Freeway, the party come across a small three year old girl. She is crying and pleading for the party’s assistance. She says that her parents are no longer talking to her and she doesn’t understand why. Tim and Hugh follow the child into a forest while the rest of the party play cards in the back of Grundle’s cart.",
                    "When they reach the girl’s parents what they find is two corpses currently decomposing, essentially a mass of maggots, beetles and other insects swarming the rotting bodies. With Tim’s knowledge of arcana, he surveys the area where the bodies of the dead parents are and notices a strange magical aura identical to the Countess’ daughter in New Pertha. After conjuring an illusion to make it seem like the bodies disappear, he urges Hugh to take the girl back to the cart. Hugh convinces the girl to follow her (after being unable to overpower the young girl in strength) and leads her towards the rest of the party. Dig receives a message from the wizard and together they burn the corpses and the surrounding blighted area and purifying it, then using their mastery of the arcane to contain the flames as to prevent a forest fire.",
                    "Unfortunately, as the girl is within sight of the cart she starts coughing hysterically and frothing at the mouth, and her eyes are glazed over. Hugh who lets go of the girl is looking around in confusion and unsure of what to do. This uncertainty however, is quickly resolved as Sir Styx sends his greatspear flying through the air. The greatspear lodges itself into the little girl’s forehead and with its momentum, completely shatters the girl’s skull, sending fragments of bone and brain matter dispersed on the ground.  The party witnesses all of this and is completely shocked at the events which have unfolded. They argue over what the goblin has done but they are forced to continue the journey lest more damage is done to the land. The party decide to hold a funeral for the child and press forward with heavy hearts.",
                    "~~~",
                    "There are two guards stationed at the front of Wind Thorp Fort and after much arguing they are finally let in (Dig manages to convince the guard that dragonborn are immune to disease). Inside, he meets Lux, a priestess who is in charge of the defence against the undead horde starting to emerge in West Australis. She directs the party to the Kings Forest where they must amass 30 unicorn horns in order for her to create an elixir which may cure those who are still in the early stages of the plague. She also orders them to travel to the Temple of Kings which she senses to be the source of the corruption. The party tell Lux to travel with Grundle and the cart towards New Pertha to attempt to heal the daughter of the countess.",
                    "After about thirty minutes of travel south from the fort, the party encounter a makeshift encampment of sort. There are a group of gnolls and what seems to be cultists patrolling the area and a batch of unknown eggs. They decide to wait until night to investigate the encampment, motivated by Hugh’s piano playing. Hugh also insisted on singing and dancing but previous experiences with the off-tune, uncoordinated bard caused the party to decline.",
                    "Night falls and the party assault the camp, Robin opting for a stealthy approach. He climbs up one of the watchtowers, aided with his darkvision, and slits the throats of one of the gnolls. Meanwhile, Tim causes a distraction by shooting out a bright blinding light as they all travel closer to the gnolls in the watchtowers. As the ballistas are occupied on the distraction and gnolls are dropping left and right, the party notice two important things. One, a cult fanatic is chanting dark arcane liturgies on a mound of dead bodies, and two, a batch of unknown eggs being prodded at by another cultist. The gnolls surrender after the relentless assault and offer to aid the party, provided they stop the cultist from harming their eggs.",
                    "Sir Styx, certainly the brightest of the bunch, agrees to help the gnolls in protecting their eggs, after pondering the existence of gnoll eggs and the biology of it all. Strained by the mere act of thinking, Sir Styx charges forward to the cult fanatic upon his trusty boar mount, Sir Nguyen.",
                    "With a combination of luck (ballistas jamming and incredible crit rolls) and Hugh’s diguise-self skills, the party manage to dispatch of the rest of the cultists and the cult fanatic. The rest of the gnolls who had aided the party are interrogated and subsequently killed (Sir Styx squeezes one of the gnoll skulls to a pulp) after it is discovered that the eggs are in fact kobold eggs. Due to the goblin’s violent tendencies, the corrosive blood of the gnolls destroys all but one of the kobold eggs, which the party decides to protect.",
                    "Their attention then turns to the mound of bodies that were previously engulfed in blue flames. There is a discussion to dump the bodies in the river but fear of poisoning the entire population of West Australis led to the decision to burn the bodies instead. However, they accidentally complete the ritual instead and before them, a dark mass develops and darkens the sky.",
                    "The figure reveals itself to be Abbadon, the primary adviser of Lucifer and with one wave of motion siphons the souls of Tim and Hugh. Before they are completely killed, Cassiel once again appears in spectacular fashion and casts a holy shield around the party before collapsing to the ground, exhausting all her powers.",
                    "Dig and Tim charge up their arcane energies...",
                    "Robin takes out his trusty boomstick once more...",
                    "Sir Styx hoists his greatspear in the air ready for battle...",
                    "Hugh... is shitting himself...",
                    "TO BE CONTINUED"]

                    "Part": 2,
                    "Text": ["Bickman and the Boys were currently shielded by some form of divine energy from their recurring saviour, Cassiel. Before them a menacing Abbadon towered over Bickman and the Boys. After being exposed to some lengthy exposition about prophecies and demons and hell and black bibles and ... they were transported to a hellish realm. Fiery tendrils grasped at their holy shield and deathly screams chilled the air as Abbadon revealed to them their grand plan.",
                    "Australis was to be doomed. Lucifer would destroy the deities before gaining dominion of the whole plane. And his dark apostles would make sure of it.",
                    "One by one the dark lord’s generals and closest advisors circled the party and the situation was looking more dire by the second. Sir Styx hurled insults at all the demonic beings he could see and Dig was busy racking his mind for any incantations or spells that could help them in this mess. But deep down they all knew that their deaths would be inevitable, that these overpowering forces would signify the end for them unless there was a miracle.",
                    "And a miracle did occur.",
                    "Cassiel pleaded to Abbadon to spare the lives of the adventurers and instead offered her servitude as a replacement. Abbadon considered this briefly and eventually gave in to the temptation. After all, having an angel (and the LAST angel at that) being their plaything would be a morale boost for the demonic hosts and Abbadon’s imagination ran wild with all the other potential ... uses for her in the future.",
                    "Cassiel whispered to Tim of Felbourne, “Forgive yourself for the past, you could not have known what you did.”",
                    "Then as her eyes began to well up in what looked like fear, something which the party never anticipated a divine being to feel, says to the rest of the party, “Save this world, I know you can stop Lucifer.”",
                    "The party’s vision darkened and before anyone could object, they all lost consciousness.",
                    "For what seemed like an eternity after all that transpired in that hellish dimension, the party slowly regained consciousness and found themselves at the gnoll encampment. There were no signs of the dark apostles that they had just encountered and Cassiel was similarly nowhere to be seen.",
                    "Sir Styx pat his boar on the head and Sir Nguyen seemed to leap at him in excitement. Tim knelt down at where the party was knocked unconscious and noticed two shining gems where Cassiel’s tears had landed. They were beautiful gems, supernaturally so, and the light was refracted in such a way that even the goblin barbarian was moved. Almost instinctively, Sir Styx nabbed the two gems and shoved them into the mouths of the “head trophies” that adorned his belt. Hugh was somewhat put off by this and uneasily played his lute (unsuccessfully) as the party contemplated their next actions.",
                    "“There was fear in her eyes,” Tim said, looking visibly shaken, “we could have saved her.”",
                    "“Don’t kid yourself wizard. Our magic before those demons was nothing but a charlatan’s trick.” Dig said.",
                    "“Don’t compare my magic to yours sorcerer! I had to learn my art and master the arcane whilst you rely on your draconic heritage.”",
                    "“Well, well, looks like we have some sort of upstart librarian here.” Dig chortles.",
                    "“Lib- why you mother-!” Tim hoisted his staff into the air and stared the dragonborn down with icy eyes.",
                    "Robin stepped in between the two spellcasters of the party and brandished his daggers. No words were needed. Bickman and the Boys were definitely on edge after the whole ordeal and tension was high. Seeing this unfold before him, Hugh continued furiously playing his lute trying to calm the situation. Unfortunately, this only worsened it due to his stress levels.",
                    "Tim backed down and regained his usual calm composure, “Hm. Well either way, I think we need to continue to the King’s Forest. I don’t know the complete story or the exact plans that this Lucifer has for our world, but right now I do know that West Australis is experiencing a plague. As the priestess Lux requested, we need to get these unicorn horns and purify this temple.”",
                    "“Fuck yeah let’s go then, I want to crack some skulls!” Sir Styx exclaimed as he leaped onto Sir Nguyen once more.",
                    "Robin picked up the kobold egg that was on the ground beside him and cradled it in his arms and nodded to the party. With heavy hearts and an uncertain future, the party pressed forward to the King’s Forest.",
                    "~~~",
                    "After another day of travel, Bickman and the Boys arrived at the entrance to the King’s Forest. They felt the calming winds brush over them and soothe their aching bones.",
                    "“Should I play a tune, boys?” Hugh asked.",
                    "“Better not, I don’t want a headache.” Dig said.",
                    "There was brief laughter by the party (with the exception of the bruised bard) as they made their way closer to the mouth of the forest. There appeared to be a sign nailed into one of the gargantuan trees of the forest. The script had a dwarven aesthetic and the runic symbols that were being used seemed quite foreign to the party. Hugh poured a little bit of soot on the ground and cast Comprehend Languages, which allowed him to recognise the words as being orcish. He translated it for the rest of the party: Easy to get lost. Turn back.",
                    "The party were bemused and unsure what to make of the message. It wasn’t exactly a warning as much as it was a simple truth. It was well known that the forest was something of a labyrinth and without a skilled navigator, it would be quite trivial to lose oneself in the twisting paths of the King’s Forest. Ignoring the message, Sir Styx began to ride nonchalantly into the entrance of the forest. All of a sudden without a warning, there was an intense humming as a stone-tipped arrow ripped through the air and embedded himself a few metres away from Sir Nguyen’s head.",
                    "“That was a warning shot, the second will not miss. Stay back.” a voice resounded from somewhere in the forest.",
                    "“No one threatens me and my boar, get out here and face me!” roared the clearly aggravated goblin.",
                    "The rest of the party started drawing their weapons, and Robin’s perceptive eyes scanned the entire area but could not locate the source of the voice. Then, in the corner of Robin’s eyes he noticed another arrow streaking through the air right at his face.",
                    "Thankfully, his high dexterity and nimbleness allowed him to back-flip out of the way (keeping his mind that the kobold egg is still in his arms). This time, he definitely knew where the voice was coming from. Slowly, perched on a branch of one of the large trees there was a hooded figure wielding a shortbow, and a sheathed shortsword hanging by the figure’s side. With absolute grace and charm, the figure leaped from the tree and landed in front of the party squarely on both feet.",
                    "“I see you did not heed my warning,” the mysterious person remarked, “do you seek early deaths?”",
                    "As these words were being spoken, Sir Styx dismounted and bellowed, “Who are you?!”",
                    "The attacker lifted the hood of her cloak and the party was stunned as before them was a female half-orc, with light green skin and dark alluring eyes.",
                    "“You can call me Saroza, the ranger of the King’s Forest.”",
                    "~~~",
                    "Sir Styx was immediately entranced, he had never witnessed such beauty. (Well in honesty, anything with tits was good enough for Sir Styx, but this woman was a greenskin, just like himself).",
                    "“I apologise, malady.” Sir Styx clumsily said.",
                    "“Malady? That’s not even the right fucking word,” Hugh said as he stretched his muscles, “allow me.”",
                    "As the bard confidently approached the ranger, Saroza drew her shortsword in a flash and had it mere inches away from Hugh’s throat.",
                    "“Do not step any closer, stranger. Tell me, why are you here in this forest?” Saroza questioned him.",
                    "“Fear not malady, I mean m’lady, I mean for fuck’s sake. We’re here to kill some unicorns and save some temple or something. Surely you know West Australis is plagued right?”",
                    "“You and your band have a link to this plague?”",
                    "“Yes.”",
                    "“We’re heroes, my beautiful lady.” Sir Styx attempted to smile seductively but strained his face and ended up looking in pain.",
                    "The dragonborn sorcerer Dig walked up to Saroza and said, “We are Bickman and the Boys. We are going to stop this thing.”",
                    "“Allow me to explain in depth,” Hugh said, as he conjured a piano out of pure arcane energy. “Story time.”",
                    "After recounting past events and introducing themselves to Saroza, she finally withdrew her shortsword from Hugh’s neck. She agreed to guide the party in the forest if it was the greater good of the land, especially if the story of Lucifer and the prophecy was true and not some conjured fantasy. Saroza requested to join them in their quest and without much discord, the party agreed (Sir Styx even more so). Robin strapped the kobold egg with some hempen rope onto his back and the party ventured forward into the forest.",
                    "~~~",
                    "It wasn’t long until the party encountered an entire group of unicorns in a forest clearing. They were majestic creatures and their horn glistened in the light. The party decided that they needed these unicorn horns no matter the cost and edged closer in the shadows. Unfortunately, Dig tripped over his own tail and face planted on the ground, which alerted the entirety of the herd. In order to salvage the situation Dig cast Sleep and three unicorns fell to the ground. Whilst watching the rest of the herd escape off into the distance, Hugh cast Comprehend Languages and attempted to communicate with the unicorns.",
                    "The bard told the unicorns of their plight and that they needed their horns to purify poison. The unicorn did not speak verbally but was able to communicate to Hugh through magic. It would lead Bickman and the Boys to the leader of the unicorns and discuss the matter further.",
                    "After locating the herd, the Alpha Unicorn was greeted by the party and three of it’s own with leads attached to them. It wasn’t happy with that, but upon seeing Saroza it quickly relaxed itself and nudged closer towards her. Saroza fed the unicorn with some goodberries from her pouch that she had gathered earlier in the day. Hugh tried diplomatically reasoning with the unicorn for their horns but it seemed that there was no other way of doing so without first killing the unicorns, an idea that Dig suggested but was quickly refuted by Tim. Unable to resolve the situation, the head unicorn led them towards the head druid of the forest.",
                    "~~~",
                    "“No, you cannot have the horns.”",
                    "The head druid of the forest was definitely a man, probably somewhere in his forties. He had unruly long hair and a free flowing beard. Arcane energies were dancing on the tip of his staff as the party approached him. Saroza introduced the druid as Cephalus Treefather, who had ironically been her father since the deaths of her original parents. The sight of his foster daughter seemed to relax the druid but the request of the party was definitely unsettling to him.",
                    "Dig said, “You’re kidding me right? West Australis needs the curative powers of the unicorn horns, we would only need thirty. It’s for the greater good.”",
                    "“That would be subjective,” Cephalus said, “everything must be in good balance.”",
                    "“Thirty unicorns are definitely worth less than the lives of all the common races in West Australis.”",
                    "“I used to live amongst civilisation dear dragonborn, and everyday was the same. Corruption, deceit, murder, rape, death... they are a plague themselves to this land. Their end will be ironic. A plague being wiped out by another plague.”",
                    "Dig was now visibly frustrated and arcane energies were beginning to emanate from the entirety of his body. “You are fake news. I know druids care only for balance and neutrality but this will spell the end for the land. Have you no common sense, man?”",
                    "“Do not take that tone with me boy. You do not wish to engage me in open magic combat.”",
                    "Before an all out war broke out, Tim stepped forward and rested his hand on Dig’s shoulder. “We are not here to start trouble, Dig. If the druid does not allow it then we have no choice but to obey him.”",
                    "“I hate these hippies.” snorted Dig.",
                    "Saroza pleaded, “Father, you cannot mean to say you will not help these strangers. Their cause is a noble one. You know the prophecies too. If this is indeed the same prophecy, then stopping this demon would be in everyone’s best interest... no matter the cost.”",
                    "Sir Styx’s heart skipped a beat, perhaps several.",
                    "Cephalus’ brows furrowed, “I cannot allow them to harm the unicorns. But you are right my dear, stopping his demon lord is of high priority regardless of my stance on things.” Cephalus turned to the party, “Very well. I will help you will this cure.”",
                    "Robin unsheathed his daggers and walked towards the head unicorn.",
                    "“Without needless bloodshed,” Cephalus said, “I will fashion a remedy from the plants of this forest. In the meantime, the other problem which I’m sure you’ve already been told of is the temple.”",
                    "“Ah yes, this temple we’ve heard so much of. What is so special about it?” Hugh wondered.",
                    "“The temple of kings is what it is called. Long ago, the druids of this forest and the king of Australis agreed to protect the ancient tomb where all the kings of Australis would rest. The magic and energy in that temple are sacred and some believe it contributed to the wellbeing of the land. As I’m sure you can gather, this place being corrupted can only spell disaster on us all.”",
                    "Dig interrogated the druid, “but what about the cure? A priestess told us that purifying this temple would cure those in the early stages but those who have progressed further into the disease would still require a cure.”",
                    "“I promise that if you help me to purify this temple, I will give you as much of the curative medicine that I can.”",
                    "“Hmph.”",
                    "“Well if that’s all, everyone please follow me to the temple. I have already sent out the rest of the druids to the task but none have returned since yesterday. Hopefully you lot prove to be worth more than my useless apprentices.”",
                    "The druid started walking off and urged the rest of the party to follow. Although Bickman and the Boys were reluctant to do so, they recognised that everything rested on the whim of Cephalus and they were compelled to follow. Dig grumbled to himself quietly that he couldn’t kick the druid’s ass but quickly reconsidered when Robin tapped his shoulder and redirected his eyes to their surroundings. All around them were centaurs, satyrs, dinosaurs and all manner of woodland creatures poised and ready to attack. If a fight had broken out, the party would have been slain in a moment’s notice. The sorcerer gulped at the close call and continued to trudge along after Cephalus.",
                    "~~~",
                    "The party entered a portal at the entrance of the temple of kings and Cephalus wished them good luck once more.",
                    "“You better have that cure.” Dig warned as the portal closed in behind them.",
                    "“I am sorry for my father, he hasn’t been the same of late. Something has been bothering him.” Saroza said.",
                    "“It’s not your fault ranger, some people are just too stubborn.”",
                    "“Look who’s talking.” Tim muttered as he lit his torch.",
                    "Now with illumination, the non-darkvision members could see several bodies on the stone floor. Some were bled out completely while others were barely recognisable. In front of them was a man gasping for breath with a deep slashing wound across his chest. With a blood gurgled voice the druid explained that all the druids that were sent down into the temple to deal with the problem were promptly slain and none remained.",
                    "“Who was it? Who’s inside of here?” Sir Styx asked. His boar squealed as if in mimicry.",
                    "“Me-Merihim. The prince of plagues. He was too much for us. Turn back. You cannot face him.” Within moments, the man was dead, the pain having finally caught up with him.",
                    "“A terrible loss,” Saroza frowned, “I know the druids of this forest. I rarely spoke to them but they seemed like good people.”",
                    "“More good people will die, malady,” Sir Styx said, “that’s why we gotta stop this whoreson.” “Indeed.”",
                    "“I’ll protect you, malady.”",
                    "“Please stop flexing.”",
                    "“Ok.”",
                    "In front of the party was a strange door humming with an intense energy. Hugh felt drawn in by these energies and as he stepped closer noticed another inscription on the door. He asked Dig if he had witnessed something like this before. He had not. Tim took out his spellbook and flicked through several pages before remarking that this door was something to do with luck.",
                    "“Luck?” Hugh asked.",
                    "Tim nodded, “Unluckiness, to be precise. I don’t know the exact workings of this door but I think that unluckiness will open the way.”",
                    "“I don’t think so, I’ve never heard of such magic,” Hugh said as he reached towards the mystical door. Sure enough, as soon as his hand made contact with it, the energies seem to weaken slightly.",
                    "Sir Styx could not suppress his laughter at witnessing this. “Poor bastard.”",
                    "“Whatever, mate. Go fuck your boar.”",
                    "Eventually the party worked it out. There was a rope with seven knots on it, the party tied six more to make thirteen. They then found a mirror in the room and smashed it into several pieces. Finally, they picked up a ladder that was on the floor and propped it against the door before they all individually walked underneath it. As they did so, the door’s energies completely vanished and the party had entered a long dark passageway. This passageway seemed to stretch on considerably in both directions. Tim walked back out the door and dimmed his torch using magic, the party knew that something was inside and rushing headfirst was not a great strategy. Dig, Sir Styx and Hugh managed to conceal themselves in the shadow and they made their way to the left passageway. Sure enough after several metres, they heard the rustling of armor at the end of the passageway. There were two gnolls busy looting the bodies of some more dead druids, with their backs facing the trio. With expert aim, Sir Styx sent his greatspear flying through the air before it impaled one of the gnolls into the stone wall. In the meantime, Dig used the distraction to rush at the remaining gnoll and tackled him into the ground, casting Shocking Grasp. The gnoll was electrocuted for a few seconds before finally managing to push the dragonborn off itself. Before it could recover, a rapier from Hugh sent it back to its creator.",
                    "“They stood no chance, boys. Easy fucking peasy mate.” Hugh laughed.",
                    "Unfortunately, the sound of fighting had alerted more visitors from the other end of the passageway behind the trio. They spun around and could not see them yet, but could definitely hear the clinking of armour. Tim, Saroza and Robin who had remained behind in the door way stepped out to assist them and to meet the attackers. Two more gnolls showed up and were immediately intercepted by them. Mercilessly, one of the gnolls attacked at Saroza who managed to duck underneath the swing of its sword, before digging her own blade into the gap of the gnoll’s armor. As the gnoll dropped onto its knees in defeat, its companion leapt at Robin, ready to bite at the kobold’s head. Wary of damage to the kobold egg at his back, Robin backpedaled to gain more distance but could not risk an attack. Seeing this, Tim lifted his staff and jammed it into the distracted gnoll, before sending several arcane blasts into its body. It’s eyes rolled back and there was a brief pause before its body suddenly exploded into several bits and pieces, innards and blood now splattered across the ground.",
                    "Robin nodded at Tim in appreciation, who smiled and gave him the kobold a fist bump.  The party composed themselves and continued along the path.",
                    "~~~",
                    "Bickman and the Boys entered a large room with two massive pedestals and an intense light source in the middle of the room. Around them there were six leavers each with symbols above them showing some manner of winged creature. While the rest of the party were busy trying to decipher the codes, Dig decided to take matter into his own hands and he promptly pulled down one of the levers. Without warning, a chute above them opened and several zombies dropped down into a heap. There was a moment of hesitation and uncertainty from the party, before the walking corpses started slowly getting up and advancing towards them.",
                    "“You’ve got to be kidding me, mate,” Hugh said as he took out his rapier, “this is the last time I let you pull a lever.”",
                    "Sir Styx rushed into the group of zombies in an attempt to impress Saroza. He entered a ferocious rage and slashed wildly at the horde while atop his hardy boar mount. With a single  horizontal swing he managed to fell three of the zombies, but they kept advancing. Slowly but surely, they kept advancing. In his state of rage, Sir Styx did not realise that the zombies he had knocked down were slowly getting back up. He was overwhelmed and slammed at multiple times before he went down, collapsing on top of Sir Nguyen. Saroza, witnessing all of this, seemed to be deeply concerned but at the same time, extremely annoyed at such stupidity. She blessed her arrows with hail of thorns and proceeded to pelt the group of zombies with her longbow. The zombies were utterly eviscerated by the artillery that was Saroza. She rushed to Sir Styx’s body which was on the ground to check if he was still alive. As if by pure coincidence, Sir Styx awoke as soon as the love of his life reached him.",
                    "He let out a ginger smile, “are you an angel, malady.”",
                    "Saroza was speechless and genuinely confused, “please stop flexing and get up.”",
                    "“As you wish, malady.”",
                    "~~~",
                    "After some rest and a bit more traversing, the party finally found the correct order for the levers in this room. After the sixth leaver was finally pulled there was a slight rumbling in the ground. The party braced themselves for another group of zombies but instead, the light in the middle of the room started... dancing. The flames flickered violently and the very stone seemed to tremble at the amount of energy that was being generated. This continued for another thirty seconds before the energy subsided and in front of the party where the flames once were, a Pegasus.",
                    "The winged horse was majestic and seemed to radiate out pure divine energy. The Pegasus was a holy creature that was said to carry some of the deities of this world. The party was dumbfounded as it made its way to the party. It seemed to go from Dig, to Hugh, to Saroza, and Tim in a cycle. It was as if it couldn’t make up it’s mind.",
                    "“Surely you don’t think...” Saroza said.",
                    "“I think it means to choose a companion, like in the tales. It only chooses those of pure heart.” Tim said, eyes widening.",
                    "Sir Styx pats his boar on the head and whispers into its ear, “don’t worry, you’re the only one for me.”",
                    "Sir Nguyen squealed in joy.",
                    "“Well, as the leader of this group, I propose that it be mine.” Dig suggested.",
                    "“You’re a dragonborn, your scaly skin would properly irritate its back every time you mounted it.” Tim argued.",
                    "“Suck it, you glorified scholar.”",
                    "As the two spellcasters once again argued, Hugh conjured a guitar out of thin air and started playing. Robin preemptively put his hands to his ears to prevent permanent brain damage, but to his surprise, the music that was coming out of the bard was surprisingly good... entrancing. The Pegasus stopped moving and bowed into head to the feet of Hugh, who smiled fondly.",
                    "“I will call you Pepe, after my dead father. May we make many great tales, my good man.”",
                    "The Pegasus lifted its head slowly, neighing as if in agreement.",
                    "“They are intelligent creatures, Hugh. I think he made the right choice in the end.” The wizard said.",
                    "“Ah well, can’t win them all I suppose.” said Dig.",
                    "~~~",
                    "There was only one more room left in the temple of kings. They had dispatched of a few cultists and troglodytes leading up to this room and had found out that Merihim was still being ritually summoned into this plane by two cultists. They could not just rush into the room with reckless abandon, doing such would lead to likely death. Hugh proposed a genius solution.",
                    "The bard decided he would use his Disguise Self spell and copy the appearance of one of the cultists to infiltrate the room. Sir Styx commented that he would prefer to just charge in and end the demon once and for all, but Saroza persuaded him otherwise (with minimal effort).",
                    "“Well, wish me luck.” Those were Hugh’s final words before he opened the door in his cultist disguise. The rest of the party hid in the shadows as he entered.",
                    "Before him was a huge dark figure, with strange poisons dripping from its mouth and a snarled expression. It had no eyes but instead two large gaping holes for eye sockets, and a long, black tongue which dangled loosely from its open mouth. Two cultists were present, one on either side of this being, chanting in some ancient language. They both turned to face the bard, interrupting their ritual for a moment.",
                    "“What are you doing here, you should be outside guarding the doorway!” One of the cultists barked.",
                    "“Ah yes, well, you see, I just wanted to...” Hugh paused, “see how the ritual was going.”",
                    "“See how the ritual was... going?”",
                    "“Yes, and I reckon that it’s in your best interest to stop it.”",
                    "The cultist was suspicious, “who are you? what is your name?”",
                    "“Hugh.” FUCK, Hugh though to himself, “I mean, WHO are you? Ha. Ha. Ha.”",
                    "The stage fright had clearly gotten to him and his cover was now blown. Hugh cursed under his breath and and let the magical disguise dissipate. He turned to his comrades who were still hiding outside the room and yelled at the top of his lungs, “Attttaaaaaackkkkkk!”",
                    "As Bickman and the Boys rushed in to the room, Hugh had already drawn his rapier and lunged at the heart of one of the cultists. The cultist had no time to react or admire the finesse of the strike as it dropped to the ground dead, instantly. The other cultist retreated to the back of the room and attempted to continue its chant. Hugh could now see that there were four massive chains attached to Merihim, who was still in an ethereal form, and that there was probably not that much time remaining. Sure enough, one of the chains cracked and the cultist was still shouting and chanting as it retreated away from the bard.",
                    "“Come on, all we have to do is kill the cultist!” Hugh shouted.",
                    "“Yeah about that...” Tim mumbled.",
                    "Before the party, two massive skeletal beings started to arise from two large sarcophagi in the sides of the room. They were at least nine feet tall and a blue burning flame was visible in their eye sockets. The skeleton on the right had an ornately crafted longbow and a quiver that contained a bundle of spectral arrows. The skeleton on the left sported an unbelievably large greatsword that looked like it could cleave an entire house in two.",
                    "“We’ve got company, Hugh! You take care of the cultist!” Saroza shouted.",
                    "“Wights. Terribly large ones too, unfortunately.” Tim said.",
                    "“Alright, Saroza, Robin and Tim, take care of the one on the right! We will fight the one on the left!” Dig ordered.",
                    "Robin, who was not one for many words, gritted his teeth and said, “This isn’t good.”",
                    "~~~",
                    "The wight on the right fired at Saroza without hesitation. The spectral arrows seemed to splash against the leather armor of the half-orc ranger, which sent her flying a couple of metres backwards. Before she fell to the ground she let loose her own arrows which struck the wight in its left shoulder. Trying to take advantage of the situation, Tim dropped his staff and brought both his hands together, conjuring a frightening bolt of thunder to cast Witch Bolt. The wizard unclasped his hands and sent a stream of brilliant dazzling power at the wight and sent a million volts down its spine. Robin was still weary of his kobold egg, and instead opted to use his boomstick. The first two shots missed as the unusually agile wight sidestepped both, but the third hit it straight in its head. The wight, now incredibly charred from Tim’s witch bolt and injured from the ranged attacks, let out one more desperate attack at the downed Saroza. Before Tim or Robin could stop this, the arrow was sent flying with an incredible force that even Hugh from the other side of the room could feel. Saroza leapt back up onto her feet and in one swift motion drew her longbow back and let loose an arrow with hail of thorns. Her arrow sliced through the air like butter and straight into the incoming arrow, splitting it vertically in half. The wight’s mouth stood agape as the arrow shattered its skull and finally ended its life.",
                    "Meanwhile, the fight on the left wight was not turning out as expected. Sir Styx had thrown his greatspear at the wight that was wielding a greatsword. Still obsessed with winning the ranger’s affection he exclaimed to her, “Watch this, malady!”",
                    "He hurled the greatspear while facing straight at Saroza, not checking where he was throwing it. Sure enough, the spear throw completely whiffed and was now on the ground beside where the wight was standing. The wight stared at the greatspear for a moment before it picked it up and snapped it with ease. Saroza rolled her eyes and started firing on the wight. In anguish, Sir Styx and Sir Nguyen charged at the wight. Although completely disarmed and with no weapon, the goblin barbarian was not without heart. In a show of acrobatics and dexterous ability, Sir Styx managed to grab the two halves of the greatspear whilst riding atop Sir Nguyen, and leapt high into the air to embed both ends into the wight. Sir Styx was now dangling on the wight with the remains of his spear and hanging on for dear life as the wight thrashed about. Dig who had been watching silently and preparing his spell, had finally conjured enough energy. With intense arcane energies now swirling around him he got behind the unsuspecting wight and with no mercy sent a virtually un-ending stream of magic missiles at the base of the wight’s skull. The wight fell to its knees and with a resounding crack, shattered into several bone shards, which Sir Styx clambered out of.",
                    "As Hugh parried the desperate attack of the final cultist and then jabbed the pointy end of the rapier into its neck, the ethereal form of Merihim suddenly grew weaker. The ritual had definitely stopped.",
                    "“I fucking did it boys! I fucking-!”",
                    "Before Hugh could finish his sentence, a dark, unsettling voice penetrated the minds of the entire party.",
                    "A foul curse upon you mortals. You will not escape this place. Your corpses will decorate the temple.",
                    "From the ethereal Merihim’s gaping mouth, a noxious miasma started filling up the room. Thick blankets of poison mist began to cover the exit of the room. The party heard Merihim cackling before it disappeared for good. The party needed to escape, but the poison was travelling so fast it would be a matter of seconds whether they could make it out or not. Sir Styx tied hempen rope to the greatsword and to Pepe, who swept Hugh off his feet to get to the exit. Sir Nguyen assisted Dig to the escape.",
                    "But in the end. Not all could escape the miasma.",
                    "~~~",
                    "Sir Nguyen and Dig were on the ground panting in pain as the poison started to infect their entire body. The party were outside the temple now and managed to escape, but it looked grim for the two poisoned party members.",
                    "Tears were streaming from Sir Styx’s eyes, “Please, someone save him. He’s all I got!”",
                    "The goblin rushed to Sir Nguyen’s side and picked the boar up, and went running off into the distance.",
                    "“Fool! You will be poisoned too!” Dig yelled after Sir Styx, hands outstretched, and still gasping for air.",
                    "“He’s going to my father.” Saroza said, still slightly hurt from the battle.",
                    "Hugh cast cure light wounds in an attempt to remedy Dig but to no avail.",
                    "“We need to follow him, the druid is our only hope for now.” Tim said.",
                    "The party arrive at the forest clearing where they had previously met the druid. With a stroke of pure luck, Cephalus appeared as the party arrived, holding a vial filled with a darkish brown liquid.",
                    "“Take this, as promised. Drink half of the vial each and you will be cured.”",
                    "Dig downed half of the vial in an instant and like clockwork, the symptoms immediately disappeared and he was back to normal. He chucked the vial to Sir Styx and beckoned him to drink.",
                    "Sir Styx refused. Without his boar, he didn’t need to live. In what shocked the party as well as the woodland creatures, he forced the liquid into Sir Nguyen. The boar was now fine, but Sir Styx suddenly collapsed to the ground, with his hands clutching at his neck. Lesions and other growths were starting to appear there and he had a few moments to live. The party panicked and rushed around trying to think of something. Robin pushed everyone aside and seeing his best friend on the ground in this situation, felt he had no choice but to try something extremely dangerous.",
                    "He slit Sir Styx’s throat. There was dead silence as everyone watched the rogue expertly open up the windpipe and allow the poisonous fumes to exit his body and dissipate into the air. A normal being would die from such an act, but Sir Styx persevered, whether through sheer determination of will or extreme luck (nat 20 ftw).",
                    "“We need more cure, Cephalus. This is hardly the deal we were expecting.” Dig complained.",
                    "“You will get what you get,” Cephalus smiled, “and you will be content with it.”",
                    "“I will murder you, you asshole!” Dig completely lost his shit and charged at the druid with his hands electrically charged with shocking grasp.",
                    "A sly smile appeared on the druid’s face as he stepped back and knocked Dig into the ground with his staff. At his waist, there was a black bible, the same that Abbadon had talked about.",
                    "“Just like the prophecy said. Well, here, have the rest of the cures”, he threw the vials at Dig’s body, “I suspect we will meet again.”",
                    "And with that, the druid vanished.",
                    "~~~",
                    "There was no time to contemplate such matters. Saroza was perplexed by the events that occurred but travelling with Bickman and the Boys had conditioned her to madness. The party traveled for three days back to New Pertha where they would rendezvous with Lux at the Burswood Court.",
                    "When they arrived, they were first greeted by the all the Jarl’s men and the Jarl outside of the room that the countess’ daughter was in.",
                    "Grundle approached the party and said, “well it’s a good thing you all are here, lads. Got some good news for Thorin.”",
                    "“Fuck Thorin,” said Sir Styx, “where is that priestess we have the cure.”",
                    "“Ah yes, about that... I dropped the cure that she had when she first got here.”",
                    "“You... Grundle... what the actual fu-”",
                    "“Anyway, gotta go! Me and my boys will wait for you outside, catch you later lads!”",
                    "Lux slammed open the door of the infirmary, “Get in, now! I need those vials!”",
                    "The party entered the room and before them was the sick daughter, but now an equally sick Countess.",
                    "“H-h-how did this happen?” stammered Tim.",
                    "“She wouldn’t listen to me”, Lux said, “she stayed by her daughter’s side and now I’m afraid both are sick. I could have saved them but Grundle... well that’s in the past. We need those cures now.”",
                    "“Certainly my dear.” Dig said as he immediately poured the vial down both of the patient’s throats.",
                    "A few moments passed, the Jarl had now approached closer to the door and was watching intently, sweat pouring down his face. Then with no warning at all, the daughter breathed her last.",
                    "“What!?” Lux exclaimed.",
                    "The party couldn’t believe their eyes. Similarly, the pregnant countess was now on her knees grasping at her stomach.",
                    "“Poison...” the priestess muttered, “these vials are filled with nightshade! What have you done?”",
                    "The Jarl stormed into the room, “You have poisoned my... wait what is this?”",
                    "Before Colan, the countess’ ears were now losing the illusory magic and showing pointed elven ears.",
                    "The countess’ last words were, “Lux, your vision, you must aid these people. This was not intentional, I know they are good people. Please.”",
                    "And she breathed her last.",
                    "The Jarl would not let the party explain. Dig kept repeating over and over that it was a druid that had given them these vials named Cephalus but Colan would not hear any of it. The party was banished, and it took all of the Jarl’s self-restraint to stop him from sending all the guards at Bickman and the Boys.",
                    "He said with pure fury in his words, “You have ten seconds to run before you are all killed. Go.”",
                    "Sensing the massive calamity that had now befallen Burswood court, and the massive blunder that they had caused, the party booked it out of there faster than the speed of light. As the party desperately raced out of Burswood court, the only thing that most of them could care about was to get the hell out of dodge.",

                    "Text": ["I.","Sir Styx, Robin and Dustin descended down the long flight of stairs in the royal palace of Galkoorlie, known as the Maj Tahal. It was not well lit so Dustin Hoggman had to feel his surroundings by pressing his hands against the smooth limestone walls as they descended into the unknown. Luckily for Sir Styx and Robin, who were naturally gifted with darkvision, found that traversing these stairs was a trivial matter. The only thing that concerned these two was meeting with the general of the Galkoorlie forces. Neither the kobold nor goblin had any idea of what they should expect. Additionally, Sir Styx wasn’t too good with the whole ‘communication’ thing. He preferred to smash things with his great boar blade, naturally.","They reached the bottom floor of the palace to find themselves in a large open room filled with nothing but pot plants and paintings of the past Sultanas of Galkoorlie pinned on the walls around them. Ahead of them was a long corridor which eventually lead to a sturdy looking wooden door at the end. An old dusty red carpet lined up this corridor as if welcoming visitors, yet the lack of maintenance was indicative of the number of visitors that would frequent here.","One of the accompanying guards addressed the trio, “Wait here friends while this one gets the general.”","“What’s he like, mate? Does this general of yours have a name?” Dustin enquired.","“His name is General Gunas. He is a great man but be warned. He is very serious and will not tolerate any idiocy.” The guard turned to look at Sir Styx. ","“Also, this one kindly asks that you remove those grotesque ornaments you have on your belt.” The guard was gesturing towards the decapitated heads of Keth Goblin-Gutter and a cult fanatic that Sir Styx was proudly displaying as trophies.","Sir Styx, still busy head-locking Robin at this point, looked up and grunted. “No.”","The guard made his way down this long corridor until he finally reached the door. Robin noticed that the guard gulped as he was about to knock on this door. Before he could do so however, the party started hearing a voice faintly echoing from the other side of it.","“Don’t bother knocking,” the voice said. ","“I can hear your footsteps from a mile away, son. What is it then? Did the Sultana finally realise her love for me or are you going to confess to me instead?”","The guard shifted uncomfortably. “Um, no sir, actually it’s… that is…”","“Well? Out with it then!”","“We have guests here, sir. The Sultana instructed them to meet with you. The Warband are going to attack.”","“Another raid? A trivial matter. We do not need their help.”","“They’ve sent us the heroes of Tyr. They say that tomorrow there will be a siege from 10,000 Warband forces, sir.”","There was a momentary pause after the guard said those words. The door swung open and knocked the guard to his rear, sending a loud metallic clang bouncing through the corridor to the heroes. Unlike Dustin, who was squinting his eyes to adjust to the darkness, Sir Styx and Robin could make out the man exiting from this room quite easily. The man was quite tall and well-built with neatly cropped black hair which rested perfectly on his heavy metal armour, essentially the physique which made maidens swoon and men go green with envy. As this man walked towards the heroes, he did so with a very pronounced confidence and as a result, each of these steps felt measured and calculated. Robin felt that this man had a powerful aura, not in the magical sense, but more like a lingering, yet firm, presence of authority.","Finally standing before Sir Styx and Robin, the duo were immediately taken aback by an ornate engraving of a dragon on the man’s right pauldron. This was strange, considering the fact that the Namati people did not follow the Dragon Emperor of Australis. This was almost enough to distract them from the numerous scars that populated his face, probably accrued from a lifetime of hardship and bloody battles. One of these scars ran down the right side of his face and looked to be relatively fresh. The goblin barbarian couldn’t help but feel a little intimidated and because of this, leapt up onto Robin’s outstretched hand.","Miraculously, this unusual balancing act was a success and were the circumstances different, may have impressed any witnesses. But the general didn’t seem like the sort of person to be amused by such a feat.","The man seemed to eye the two up and down for a while before finally speaking. ","“I’m general Gunas, nice to meet you and all that. You are these heroes of Tyr, I take it?”","“You bet I am!” Sir Styx exclaimed as Robin nodded in unison. Robin was beginning to shake slightly under the weight of the hulking goblin.","“Is this it then?”","“Well, no. There are a few more of us. What’s your point though?”","“Nothing,” the disappointed expression on the general’s face proved otherwise. ","“It’s just that I expected you all to be a lot taller and not so… beastly.”","I can take him, thought Sir Styx, who felt incredibly irked by this man. He tensed his muscles and stated in a very solemn voice, “Looks can be deceiving my good man.”","Dustin Hoggman placed his hands on Sir Styx’s shoulders to attempt to calm him down but to no avail. ","“There, there mate. No need to get all fussed up over this guy, we don’t even know him.”","Sir Styx continued to stand in the room flexing, with great effort one might add, in an effort to impress this newly met General Gunas. Robin began fidgeting with his revolvers in case matters got out of hand. He had to stick by his best friend, after all.","Before the situation could escalate any further, General Gunas sighed and said, “Do not take this the wrong","way but you do not look like the sort of people that I could rely on for counsel.” He continued to peer down at the three foot tall heroes standing before him. ","“In any case, I doubt you could even hold yourselves in battle. Leave the city. The people of Galkoorlie will be fine, as they have been for centuries.”","The general began turning around to leave and it was apparent that diplomacy had failed. The goblin was ready to bulrush the general and unleash his unbridled fury but suddenly, a chilling cold wind began to circulate the dim room. The paintings and pot plants simultaneously began swaying violently as this disturbance grew in intensity. PHWOOSH!","Strange purple energy accumulated into a single point in space and burst into a brilliant nexus of light that dazzled everyone. To their utter disbelief, they watched as the other party members of Bickman and the Boys materialised into the room, one by one. First Saroza, then Dig and Hugh, followed by Tim and their party cart. After they had all arrived the portal fizzled out and the crackling energies subsided as quickly as it had appeared. Sir Styx and Robin attempted to process what they had just seen. Dustin blinked rapidly to make sure that this was not some surreal dream.","General Gunas’ eyes widened as he fixated onto the wizard. ","“Tim, is that really you, my friend? It’s me! Do you recognise me, it’s Sir Dilmah!”","Tim was wincing in apparent pain and rocking back and forth. ","“O-of course I .do Sir Dilmah. It’s been ages but you’ll have to … forgive me. My foot…”","“I do not believe my eyes!” General Dilmah hadn’t even listened to Tim. ","“I have not heard from you since your expedition in Felbourne and your sudden arrest in New Pertha. What happened in-” He finally realised that Tim of Felbourne, old friend and powerful wizard, was missing his left foot. ","“Oh shit.”","The general frantically rushed past the party and up the stairs, cursing along the way. Those that had arrived through the portal created by the sphinxes got up and stood to their feet, with the exception of a certain wizard.","Dig yawned as he stretched his body out. ","“Hey.”","Robin stared blankly and responded in kind. ","“Hey.”","An enthralled Sir Styx paced hastily to his beloved Saroza, only to have her shove him into the ground with a forceful arm. Sir Styx had his head firmly planted into the ground but managed to mutter, “Good to see you too, malady.”","“Well, well. It looks like we’re reunited,” remarked Hugh the bard, “which calls for a celebratory song!” Hugh pulled a piano out of his pocket and proceeded to play a little tune from Gymnasia.","Dig walked over to the crippled wizard and asked, “Are you alright, Tim?”","All he got in response was a stern look of annoyance as Tim continued rocking back and forth in obvious distress.","“Oh just walk it off.” Hugh laughed as he played on his piano.","“Is that meant to be some sort of a joke?” Saroza said as she leant over Tim to inspect the stump where his left foot used to be.","It wasn’t the smoothest of reunions but everyone was here and the troubles were only beginning.","~~~","Moments later, the general returned in the company of two elderly women, who promptly lifted Tim onto a stretcher.","“Take him to the alchemical guild hall for further medical attention,” General Dilmah directed the two women. He placed his right hand on Tim’s shoulder and smiled reassuringly. ","“Don’t worry mate, they’ll patch you right up. We’ll talk more once you’re healed.”","Tim replied, “I was expecting you to go for a pun as well but that sounds good too.”","“Oh come on now, my friend. Do you really think I could, in good conscience, get a kick out of that?”","After the wizard passed out from the horrendous jokes that were made in his expense, he was carried out of the Maj Tahal by the nurses.","General Dilmah turned around to address the rest of the party. ","“Are you companions of Tim, then?”","“I prefer,” Dig thought his next words carefully, “bros.”","“Yeah, I’d say we are BFFs.” Sir Styx replied.","The general scratched his head. ","“Right. Well regardless, I was wrong to judge you. If you are friends of Tim, then I ask that you follow me to the war room. We have things to discuss, assuming that rumours of the Warband attacking are true.”","After Sir Styx stopped flexing his muscles, the party followed General Dilmah into the war room down the corridor. In the war room, General Dilmah made his way over to a long wooden rectangular table in the middle of the room. On top of this table was a large detailed map of what looked like the southern half of the Namati desert, specifically the layout of the city. Interestingly, the entire northern section of the desert was uncharted.","General Dilmah leaned over the table and said, “I apologise for the lack of furniture but I don’t like to sit around too much on my ass. Let me get to the point. My name is Sir Dilmah Gunas, formerly Sir Dilmah of Gee. I was born in Galkoorlie originally but have served the last ten years of my life as part of the royal guard for the Emperor Regent, Molcam Teranbul.”","Sir Styx began flexing for no apparent reason. His eyes locked with General Dilmah’s and he said, “I don’t care who you were protecting, you don’t look all that strong.”","The general was clearly perturbed and pondered for a moment. ","“I will challenge you to an arm wrestle, Sir Styx. After that, you all must listen to what I have to say.”","“Oh hell yeah! You’re going down!” Sir Styx boasted as he span towards Saroza. ","“Hey malady, mind oiling my muscles up for me?”","“Go away.” Saroza grumbled.","The goblin barbarian and the general of Galkoorlie clasped each other’s hands in their own and positioned their elbows onto the rectangular table, which caused the map to crease significantly.","“Alright,","3…” Hugh began. ","“2…” Hugh whipped out his guitar and played hype music. ","“1... Go!”","It was over within a second.","The sheepish looking general had little to say while Sir Styx danced around the room, celebrating his victory obnoxiously and loudly. Had Dilmah known that the amulet around Sir Styx’s neck increased his strength to inhuman proportions, he would have called for a rematch. Regardless, he continued to speak about his time in the royal guard and of how Arcabern became overrun by demons. The party explained their quest to the general and of the existence of Auron, which prompted the general to bring up an important part of the prophecy found in the black bibles. He explained that there was a passage which stated that the last dragon would appear and choose the rightful Dragon Emperor of Australis. This made matters relatively simple. The party would aid Galkoorlie in its defence against the Warband siege and in return, General Dilmah promised their full support in the inevitable battle against Lucifer.","“Well,” General Dilmah extended his hand out to Dig, “what say you, heroes? Will you help and defend our city?”","The dragonborn sorcerer did not return the handshake but simply glanced at each of his companions one by one, closed his eyes and remarked with a twinkle in his eye. ","“We’re the boys. You can count on us.”","~~~","The decision was made. Four tasks were given to the heroes:","1. Gather intel on the enemy forces","2. Recruit allies within the city","3. Investigate ‘Solution Ultima’ from Alchemists in the guild hall","4. Evacuate citizens to inner wall and underground pipes via the Maj Tahal","The party decided that Saroza, Sir Styx and Robin would accompany twenty scouts to scout out the approaching Warband army. Hugh, being the most charismatic of the group, volunteered to see what support he could garner within the city. Tim used his message spell to figure out the situation and volunteered to ask the alchemists about ‘Solution Ultima’. After all, he was already at the guild hall having his wound treated so it would be the most efficient, he reasoned. This left the task of evacuating the citizens of Galkoorlie to Dig Bickman. After they completed their tasks they were to report to General Dilmah in the war room before the next day. Dustin Hoggman decided that he would spend his time at the royal library to gather more information on the whereabouts of more celestial arms in Australis. Without any further questions, the party ventured forward to complete their given tasks with resolute minds.","II.","Saroza and Robin promptly rendezvoused with the twenty scouts assigned by the general. Saroza and Robin also double-checked their equipment before their departure and made sure to visit the quartermaster for any extra supplies that they would need for the journey. Sir Styx on the other hand spent the majority of the time affectionately scratching the chin of Sir Nguyen.","Sir Styx took off his cloak and placed it over his boar, making sure to completely cover its ears and snout. ","“Don’t worry little buddy. I’ll be back before you even know it.”","Sir Nguyen squealed in response and rolled onto its back to expose its underside to the goblin, who couldn’t resist but give it a belly rub.","~~~","Travelling for two hours and enduring the harsh heat was an adventure in itself. When they finally caught up to the vanguard of the Warband forces, they were all but ready to fall to their knees in exhaustion. Especially Robin, as a kobold, who absolutely abhorred the sunlight.","“Enemy scouted ahead.” One of the soldiers said as the group fell prone on the ground, waiting for them to pass. They were positioned on an elevated ridge and therefore had clear vision of the group of thirty or so walking below them. They spotted around twenty goblins, which Sir Styx was","excited to see, as well as a number of strange humanoid creatures that the party had not encountered yet.","“Who are those guys?” Robin whispered.","“Hobgoblin Ironshadows,” Saroza responded bluntly.","Sir Styx chimed in, “They any strong, malady?”","Saroza nodded coolly. ","“They are the elite fighting force of the hobgoblin forces. I’ve heard many stories about their combat prowess.”","“They’re mortal,” Robin said.","“Well, yes. What’s that supposed to mean?” Saroza asked.","“It means that a dagger to the throat is still a viable option.” The kobold licked his lips.","Creepy, Saroza thought to herself.","The scouts were about to ask more questions but Saroza raised her hand and silenced them. It seemed that one of the goblins from the group below had drifted away and was now advancing towards their position.","“What now?” One of the scouts muttered. ","“This one could easily dispatch it if need be.”","Sir Styx was about to scream in rage and barely managed to compose himself. ","“No, enough of my boys have died already. Let him come. He should recognise me.” He pointed to a neighbouring ridge. ","“The rest of you, go to the other ridge and stay unseen.”","“I’ll stay,” Robin said.","Saroza nodded. ","“Same here. I need to make sure the two of you don’t get into too much trouble.”","While the scouts did as they were told and hid some fair distance away, the lone goblin nonchalantly strolled to where Saroza, Robin, and Sir Styx were positioned. It pulled its pants down and started relieving itself when mid-stream, it finally noticed the three heroes lying prone on the sand. There was a tilting silence before its expression turned into what could be described as a mixture of embarrassment and terror.","“Mine’s bigger by the way,” Sir Styx said to Saroza.","The shocked goblin looked like it was about to screech and alert the others but thankfully sighted Sir Styx in time. ","“Warlord? Is that you?” It asked.","“I am indeed.” Sir Styx proudly responded.","The goblin pulled its pants up and clumsily scuttled over towards the party like a crab on stilts. ","“Oh my lord, it is good to see you in the flesh, finally! Our brothers and sisters in the camp have told us about you and your unrivalled strength. Oh my! You even carry the head of Keth Goblin-Gutter! You are amazing! Warlord, you are truly-”","“Oh stop it. It was easy for someone of my calibre.”","“Easy my ass,” Saroza grumbled. ","“The rest of us came to bail you out.”","Sir Styx coughed nervously. ","“Ah Saroza, malady, you always know how to make me laugh. Anyhow, it seems that you are the vanguard, little one. We need information on the enemy force. What do you know?”","The goblin racked its brain, it looked like it was struggling with a simple recall task. ","“Well, there are ten thousand of us and we are equipped with siege equipment. Orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears and us goblins of course. There are also gnoll mercenaries and harpies. There was another group but… sorry warlord, I can’t remember.” ","“You can’t remember?” Sir Styx remarked incredulously. It took Robin’s hand clamped over Sir Styx’s mouth to prevent him from yelling out in frustration. He finally relaxed. ","“When are they going to attack then?”","“Approximately tomorrow noon, my lord.”","“Ok.” Sir Styx paused to think. ","“My friends and I need access to the backline. I’m thinking a sabotage operation here. What do you reckon, Robin? What about you, malady?”","“I think we should go back to the city to inform our friends of what we’ve learnt,” Saroza suggested. ","“After all, knowing that they have aerial forces will drastically change how we approach this upcoming battle.”","Both Sir Styx and the goblin gazed at Saroza while she spoke as if enthralled by a charm spell. In truth, Sir Styx was heavily focused on Saroza’s cleavage and a disgusting pool of spittle was slowly oozing out of the side of his agape mouth. Saroza was so irritated by this that she stretched her arm out, ready to deliver a killing backhand to the barbarian’s face. But before she could so, the air became filled with the screams of dying men. They were uncomfortably close.","Robin’s eyes widened. What was happening? They looked below them and their realisation struck them hard. The Hobgoblin Ironshadows were missing.","~~~","Saroza was working overtime to come up with a plan but the sound of the scouts meeting their end was somewhat distracting to the distraught ranger. Unfortunately it was Sir Styx that came up with an idea first. He looked at the goblin that they had been talking to and nodded, almost like a code of some sort. Whether by telekinetic thought, incredible loyalty or a lack of intelligence, the goblin knew what it must do to ensure the survival of his warlord.","Sir Styx drove his boar blade into the body of his kin and immediately began digging into the sand, the fresh goblin blood still dripping from his blade. He directed Robin to do the same and when the two had buried themselves underneath the sand, Sir Styx dragged the corpse of the goblin over them. Saroza in the meantime had decided to run, knowing that she had to deliver vital information to the rest of Bickman and the Boys. She felt slightly guilty in leaving the two to their own devices but knew that sometimes, sacrifices had to be made.","The rest of the goblin scouting party eventually came to see all the commotion, only to be interrogated by the Ironshadows. When they too failed to give adequate explanation, the Ironshadows slaughtered them within mere moments. Sir Styx and Robin could do nothing but keep their mouth shut together like they stitched together surgically.","Robin was at the point of pissing his pants out of fear but calmed his nerves by thinking about voluptuous kobold maidens. This was hardly effective though since","kobolds were not the most attractive creatures in Australis, let alone Thera.","This is fucking shit, Sir Styx thought to himself while the hobgoblin elite force continued surveying the area in earnest. Completely occupied with their task, none of the Ironshadows spotted the winged horse soaring high in the sky above them, straight towards Galkoorlie.","III.","Hugh stepped into the tavern gallantly, almost knocking over a barmaid in the process. He leant over to help the poor lass up but was greeted with a slap which reverberated loudly in the room. Well I guess I’d better get to work, Hugh thought to himself. The bard took a brief moment to take in the sights and sounds of the tavern. To his disappointment, it didn’t seem like there was anything out of the ordinary. There were no drunken brawls, people dancing on tables and most importantly to Hugh Myrin, no attractive women. He let out a long, exasperated sigh composed of disappointment and a thirst which plagued his parched throat.","The bard strolled over to the counter where a stern looking bartender stood. ","“One mug of ale, please,” Hugh said as he flipped a silver piece to him.","The coin was extremely off target and landed onto the wooden floor behind the intended target. Nevertheless, the barkeep grunted and poured the drink as he was told, before sliding it over to Hugh along the counter’s surface. It almost spilled over but was heroically saved by the bard’s quick reflexes. He took a sip and immediately winced. There was too much gruit in this liquor so the sweetness of the malt was lost and was instead replaced by a lingering, bitter aftertaste that stained his mouth.","The bard looked around once more, trying to get his mind off the appalling liquor. It seemed that aside from him, the only other notable patrons were what looked like a gang of men, as well as a mysterious cloaked figure lurking in the corner of the room.","Hugh left the appalling ale on top of the counter and made his way, incredibly pompously one might add, towards the group of tavern-goers. ","“Hey, hey, who wants to join in a fight to the death against some greenskin bastards?”","None of the men paid him any heed. They seemed to be preoccupied and distant. They continued to silently sip away at their ale while deep in thought. Amongst these men was a woman clothed in a white cotton shirt and red breeches. Her olive skin and dark flowing hair caressed her hourglass figure. This captured Hugh’s attention faster than breasts on a stick. Even as an outsider he could tell that she was in charge of this group of individuals.","Yet, he noticed that she was seated with the only company being her drink. She was staring despondently into space. Every now and then, she would frown as she fidgeted with a sailor’s hat that she had placed on the table. Despite this, she was unquestionably beautiful. In some ways, this woman reminded Hugh of his late mother and one could surmise that this was partly the reason why this bard was so entranced by her.","Putting on his most suave accent, Hugh said, “What’s wrong, love? Put a smile on your dial. Turn that frown upside do-”","“Fuck off,” she replied.","“Right.” Hugh shifted uncomfortably, he was used to rejection but not before he used his fail-proof pick up lines. ","“Perhaps we got off on the wrong foot. Can I try again?”","“Go away. I am not in the mood to talk to anyone.”","“I can see that I am irritating you.”","“In that case, then please leave me be. I’ve had more than enough today of idiots.” Her dark eyes glistened in the gloomy light as tears were beginning to form.","Hugh turned serious. She was clearly troubled by something. Of course, he could have read her mind with magic if he so desired, but his peculiar sense of honour prohibited from doing so. He would have to go about this the old fashioned way. ","“I know a damsel in distress when I see one. Tell me what happened.”","“Why do you care so much, stranger?” Past her tears, these eyes were empty and devoid of emotions.","“Consider me a man that cares deeply for pretty girls,” he smiled.","“You’re kidding me.”","“Oh I would not dare, my lady. You will find that I am simply a man with exquisite tastes and coincidentally, I find you highly palatable.”","Hugh’s heart skipped a beat when he heard a small chuckle escape the woman’s lips. The colour in her eyes started to return, albeit slowly, and her frown was gradually replaced with a warm smile. This smile of melancholic beauty melted the bard’s heart faster than any fire known to man.","She rested her chin in the palm of her hands and probed Hugh. ","“Congratulations you finally wore me down. Since you’re so persistent, what’s your name?”","Hugh crossed his arms and replied with unnerving confidence, “Hugh B. Myrin. The greatest bard in Gymnasia and perhaps all of Thera at your service. What can I call you, my lady?”","“Isabella Giovinazzo.” Another smile. ","“Or perhaps the fool girl that payed any attention to this relentless bard.”","“A fine name indeed! I do say that it compliments that radiant smile of yours.”","Isabella chuckled again and jested, “I didn’t think there were still people that talked like that in this age.”","“What do you mean? This is how I always approach women. They appreciate the Gains.”","“You are truly a marvel.”","“Mother always said I was special.”","“Hugh,” she said, “you wished to hear my story, yes? Very well, I will tell you why my pirate crew and I are hanging around in a tavern in the middle of the desert.”","“How intriguing, you’re a pirate captain. Tell me more.”","Isabella explained that she was the captain of a famous pirate crew aboard the ship called The Moby Dick. She had been travelling across the Valindian Ocean for most of her life after inheriting the ship from her father. But this all came crashing down around three weeks ago when her ship was capsized by a terrible monster. She described it as an ancient beast the size of an island and impossible strength.","Hugh recalled the story that the deranged fishermen had told the party on their way to the sphinxes. The similarities between Isabella’s recount and this story gave Hugh some cause for concern. Isabella and the survivors of her crew drifted onto the southern coast of Australis and were rescued by some Namati fishermen shortly after. She was then taken in by some kind people and eventually found herself in Galkoorlie. After she finished telling her story to Hugh, she seemed visibly saddened again.","“You should be thankful that you lived,” Hugh said in an attempt to console her.","She stared into space as she continued, “There is nothing left for us to live for. We’ve lost our ship and most importantly, we’ve lost our friends.”","“You could lose more.”","“What do you mean?”","Hugh leant in to whisper into Isabella’s ear. ","“Tomorrow at some point the city is going to be attacked by the Warband.”","A brief moment of shock. ","“Then I guess everything is over.”","“No, not yet. If you and your men join in the fight with the Galkoorlie army, then I am sure that we can overcome this.”","“So what you’re saying is I risk the rest of my men.” She pointed at her crew, who were still occupied with their drink. ","“You wish for me to send them to certain death.”","Hugh shook his head. ","“Certain death is doing nothing and waiting for the Warband to invade the city. I’m asking you and your crew because you look like able fighters.","Stand with us and defend the city so that we might see another day.”","Isabella contemplated to herself for what seemed like forever. Hugh knew the gravity of the situation and understood the reality that fighting this battle would likely result in many casualties amongst not only her crew, but the entire army itself.","Finally, she spoke up. ","“Very well, Hugh. It is as you say, there is no point in waiting around for death. The least we can do is go out in a blaze of glory and honour our fallen.”","“Thank you, Isabella.”","“I do have one condition, however.” She stood up from her seat and leant close to Hugh’s face, her perfume wafted to the bard’s nose as she did so.","“Oh and what would that be then?”","Isabella gracefully wrapped her arms around the bard’s neck and gazed into his eyes. ","“Do you dance, prince charming?”","Hugh tipped his hat forward and chuckled, “If only you knew, my lady.”","IV.","Tim’s back was aching. The bed that the healers offered to the wizard was beyond uncomfortable, it was painful to rest on. Thankfully, the throbbing pain where his left foot was severed had subsided thanks to the medicinal herbs and ointments the healers applied to it. They also offered him a wooden crutch, which meant he would be up and moving in no time. At least, that was their diagnosis. Tim on the other hand, remained cautiously pessimistic. Tim was not confident of his combat either since running around in the open field was virtually impossible due to this injury.","It had been around thirty minutes since the healers had left him to fetch the master alchemist. After using his message spell, he had learnt of the ‘Solution Ultima’ plan that General Dilmah wanted the party to investigate, and thus he volunteered himself. Tim was worried. If it were up to him alone, he would insisted on going along with the scouting party to ensure they didn’t get into too much trouble. By ‘they’, he wasn’t referring to Robin and Saroza, who he trusted completely. He had travelled with Sir Styx long enough to catch on to the barbarian’s impulses and poor decision making. At the very least, he thought, Hugh and Dig wouldn’t be able to screw up such trivial tasks. Although Tim was starting to doubt that as well.","Before Tim died of overthinking and worrying for the party, a man that he presumed to be the master alchemist, entered the room. He was old and frail, relying on a walking stick to move. Tim surmised that this was probably why it had taken so long for the old man to arrive.","The old man’s voice was raspy as he spoke to Tim. ","“Are you General Gunas’ representative?”","“I am.”","Upon hearing this, the alchemist presented a vial of strange purple liquid that glistened in the dark room. ","“Very well. Let this one tell you about Solution Ultima.”","Tim listened carefully as the alchemist relayed to him the details of their plan. Solution Ultima, as they called it, was a highly volatile liquid substance that when exposed to high magical concentration, would produce a devastating explosion. This had several implications. It would spell extreme losses for the Warband but at the expense of the Galkoorlie people. Aside from the casualties, Solution Ultima would eradicate half the city and its history in an instant. This was so trivial that it was almost frightening to Tim. Certainly, this was a marvel of alchemy and a testament to human ingenuity, but it would ensure mutually assured destruction and no second chances. It would be in every sense of the word, a disaster.","“Did General Dilmah authorise this?” Tim interrogated the alchemist.","The old man shook his head. ","“No, he decided to defer judgement to someone he trusted. So to that end, what do you think, sir?”","“What do I think? Quite frankly, I think you are all fools for even suggesting, no, considering we use this.”","“Sir?”","“If we follow through with Solution Ultima then we are no better than the enemy. I’d rather we all die fighting and lose everything than resorting to blowing up half the bloody city! Besides, where can we even find a location with such powerful magic?”","“You are the wizard. This one thinks you know full well.”","Tim closed his eyes to channel his arcane powers. ","“There is an intersection of ley-lines within the middle of the city. It is ancient and highly concentrated.”","“Yes.”","“But also slow,” Tim continued, “which would mean in order to draw the Warband in to this trap we would have to leave many behind to keep them in place.”","“Yes. It is as you say.”","Tim had heard enough. ","“Seal the vial away in the most secure location that you have in this guild hall. Never bring it out again. Do you understand me?”","“This one… is not sure that is a good idea. Perhaps we could-”","“Seal the vial away,” Tim repeated bluntly as his eyes flared with an intense electric blue arcane energy, “or I will make you. I will be having a word with the general later.”","The alchemist did as he was told. It was common knowledge that angering a wizard was a quick way to meet your maker, particularly a wizard that had recently lost a foot.","V.","The evacuation was going to take a while. The amount of people in the city was almost overwhelming, even for Dig who was born in the megacity of Draconis back in the Yeuropan mainland. Dig and the Galkoorlie guards were tasked with escorting the public into the inner wall but it was quickly turning into an arduous task. The dragonborn sorcerer was being constantly bombarded by the townsfolk with questions like: Are we going to die? Why are we being evacuated? Are you going to save us? Can you spare some food? Are you a dragon, if so, can you breathe fire? If the dragonborn could indeed breathe fire, he would probably use it to stop their incessant questioning. Dig was a good man, however, so he resorted to throwing out silver pieces instead.","Dig understood that the major issue which plagued Bickman and the Boys was time. Therefore, when a gang of child thieves attempted to pickpocket Dig, he had no choice but to spare them and offer some coin. He could ill afford to waste time dishing out penalties for crimes but he could afford a silver or two. Hopefully, he was compensated though. Dragonborn love their treasure.","A young busty woman named Viola Tigolbidiz approached the sorcerer. She introduced herself and expressed her gratitude for the dragonborn’s efforts and told him to meet her after the battle. Dig agreed wholeheartedly but knew that deep down it would be all for naught if he did not survive the battle to come.","~~~","The party completed their respective tasks and were once again making their way down to the Maj Tahal. Saroza returned too but was dripping with sweat and soaked with agitation. According to her, everything would be revealed within the war room. Tim rolled his eyes upon finding out that both Sir Styx and Robin did not return.","When the party were inside the Maj Tahal and continuing down the spiralling staircase, they were shocked to find a small gang of around twenty dwarves ascending the same stairs to their left.","What are dwarves from Urulu doing all the way here in Galkoorlie? Tim thought to himself.","Dig observed these dwarves carrying what looked like Robin’s boomsticks but with longer barrels. ","“How do you do, dwarves? Pardon my curiosity, but what you are doing all the way out here in the Namati desert?”","Most of the dwarves ignored the dragonborn and pressed forward except for one who was closer to the back. ","“Sod off,” he said. ","“We didn’t come here to answer ya questions ya git.”","“You little piece of sh-”","“Excuse me my small friend,” Tim interrupted the sorcerer, “we were just curious as to where you were going with those interesting instruments of yours. Especially since you are so far out from Urulu. Surely you can tell us this much.”","“I don’t think ya heard me the first time. Sod off.”","The party were halted at the stairs with this one dwarf. The rest of them had continued past them and were out of sight. Hugh had very little experience with dwarves before because Gymnasia had very strict migration policies.","He wondered whether all dwarves were like Grundle and this dwarf before him.","Hugh leant in close to the small man’s face and whispered, “I have ways to make you talk, you know. I’m quite tired so I’ll give you a choice. The easy way?” His eyes were a slight hue of pink energy so mesmerising that it was intoxicating to be in his vicinity. ","“Or the hard way?”","The dwarf jolted back and fidgeted with his long-barrelled boomstick. He didn’t seem as combative as before. ","“Right, look, we were sent here by a man named Ked to assist with this battle of yours. What’s more, we brought a gift too as a sign of friendship between our peoples.”","“You were sent here by Ked Nelly?” Tim asked.","“Yes,” he replied, “but more specifically we were sent here in the interests of the labourers.”","“Twenty dwarves don’t look like much of a force to me,” Saroza noted.","“Aye. Twenty dwarves with these rifles might, however.” The dwarf proudly presented this firearm in the air as if pre-emptively announcing their victory.","“Interesting. I look forward to seeing you dwarves in action then,” remarked Dig. ","“If you actually hit your targets, unlike a kobold I know, then there may be hope.”","Slightly disgruntled, the dwarf rushed to reunite with the rest of his group and out of the sight of the party. They wondered what sort of gift these dwarves would leave them in a perilous time such as this.","~~~","The party entered the war room where General Dilmah was pacing back and forth in deep thought. In the middle of the room was a machine that the party recognised. It was the very same mechanism that they had witnessed Keth using at the battle outside the goblin camp near Tyr, which completely nullified the magical abilities of both Tim and Dig.","The general paced towards Tim and placed his hands on both the wizard’s shoulders. ","“You look well, old friend.”","Tim smiled. ","“I’ve been better.”","“I knew you wouldn’t be deFEATed so easily.”","There was a collective groan from the party.","“I apologise,” the general said unapologetically. ","“It is truly good to see you Tim. We have so much to catch up on but I’m afraid that will have to wait until after the battle. For now, everyone, there is the matter of this anti-magic field generator that the dwarves donated us. I’m told that Tim and Dig will find it intuitive to activate. Could you set it up near the outer wall after this meeting?”","Dig inspected the device. ","“We can set it up but I do not think we will need to resort to activating this.”","Tim agreed. ","“If they have any magic users in their ranks then it might come in handy. Unfortunately it is a double-edged sword so I’d rather not use it, honestly. Speaking of which, you and I must have a word about this Solution Ultima that the alchemists proposed.”","General Dilmah nodded. ","“Yes, of course. First you must all let me know how you went with your tasks and what you have learnt. Then, we can decide on our course of action for tomorrow.”","The party relayed to the general all the information that they had gathered. Saroza explained that Sir Styx and Robin were currently hiding underneath the sands, awaiting for the enemy force to pass by in order to infiltrate them. Tim physically head-butted the wall in frustration. Dig confirmed that the people of Galkoorlie were all evacuated into the inner walls. Hugh also announced that the pirates of the Moby Dick would also be joining in the battle. He had also discovered some troubling news.","In the very same tavern where he had met with the pirates, a member of the Antipathy had also approached him. Apparently Ked had intercepted letters that were being sent to someone in Yeuropa, written in draconic text. Hugh used his magic to understand the language and translated it for the party.","Auron is not in their possession. Call off the fleet.","-D","The party had their suspicions of who sent this letter but they could not afford to divide themselves before the major battle. They set the issue aside but remained wary that there could be a traitor within their ranks.","It was the general that broke the tense silence. ","“Musashi is a respectable warrior and a brilliant strategist. Kur’Gash on the other hand is a brute and a terror even among his own people. My friends, we must come up with a battle plan.”","Tim closed his eyes and said, “Let’s get to business.”","In the silence, Bickman and the Boys poured over the large map sprawled over the table. Dig called out different scenarios while Tim used illusions to conjure spectral armies across the map, moving them around. Saroza stood by the windows, keeping a keen eye on the horizon for the enemy. In the background, Hugh played his ‘pre-battle list of music’. This had been generally well received, with the exception of ‘Eye of the Lion’, which Hugh had taken to playing once each hour, repeatedly insisting that it was a fabled Gymnasian battle hymn, and was critical for a ‘training montage like this’.","While they planned the siege, an idea struck Tim. A memory that General Dilmah actually told him amidst tales of wenches in carriages outside the Imperial University. ","“The first rule of commanding an offensive army in Australis is not invading the Icelands in winter.” He had said, “The first rule of commanding a defensive siege in the desert is not commanding a defensive siege in the desert.”","And from there, a plan formed.","VI.","Tim slowly rested back, and set out his plan, armies of miniature men dancing on the parchment in front of him.","Tim explained, “The Warband, if they can really be called that, plan on besieging us. Galkoorlie may be isolated, but we do have some supplies. We could last for a couple of weeks which should be ample time for the reinforcements of Tyr to arrive. The only chance they have of breaking that is if they use siege engines to scale our ramparts.”","(PLAN A: SWORD - crossed markers are infantry, dot markers are longbow, diagonal markers are cavalry, ‘x’ markers are dismounted artillery, the big black area is the gate. Diagram does not include thin rows of longbowmen placed along the outer wall)","“Or buy out the gatekeeper,” Dig chimed in. ","“Just saying.”","Tim made a note – arrange for someone loyal to be on the gate. He continued. ","“The Warband come here hoping for a siege, from which we will eventually capitulate, or even more, that they can break down these walls. But we can avoid that. We stand our strongest chance using artillery and bows against them in the field. If we lose, we stage a retreat behind the walls and continue to try and break them on those. We get ourselves two bites at the cherry.” The wizard stroked his chin and added, “That isn’t all though. If the Orcs get behind the wall, we may as well have lost. Their strength is in their close quarters fighting. They will slaughter us in the melee, and if our bows and artillery keep firing then they’re as likely to kill our own men as they will the enemy. That of course says nothing of Tyr, who if the enemy take the main gate, will be totally separated from us.”","“So a pitched battle then?” General Dilmah enquired as he scrutinised the battle map. ","“You would risk the walls of this city on a pitched battle?”","“What you have to understand,” Dig broke stride, “is that if the Warband take your outer wall you have already lost. You and all of your men will die, period.”","“I do think you underestimate your men,” Tim said. ","“They are seasoned warriors, and will hold the line against the horde. Their fighting style, mixing swordsmen with pikemen, is years ahead of even the Imperial Army”.","“You know as well as I that the Imperial Army is a shadow of its former self.” The general said.","Tim set out the plan. ","“We must meet them on the battlefield. If we can pinpoint the horde, we fight a pitched battle. If not, we surround the outer wall, concentrate forces at the main gate and hope for a miracle. Our strength is in artillery and in numbers. Consider also that they have aerial forces, this will allow us to combat them effectively.”","Hugh paused his music for a moment. ","“Harpies, right? I was told that they had a captivating song. We shall see whose song is more captivating then.”","Tim continued, “The inner artillery is useless. If it can be dismounted, tell your men to move it to the outer wall. If not, tell them to re-fix it to aim in an arc upwards, so that we can at least use it as a bombard. What you can’t move, keep there to use against flyers.”","“What about our camel cavalry?” The general asked.","“We have too few to mount an effective cavalry charge amongst the horde. They will have to hold the flanks of our army or hold tight near the walls. We’ll use them to counter-charge any cavalry that the horde sends after us.”","General Dilmah prepared to leave. ","“Very well, Tim. I will set up the men according to your formation. My only request is this. Tim, stay with the women and children at the Maj Tahal.”","“Dilmah, you know what my answer is.”","“Please, Tim. You would only be risking yourself. Consider your injuries.”","Tim noticed that the general was almost pleading but stayed firm. ","“I will stay at the walls and help to command the men. This is my battle as much as it is yours. Do not deny me this, my friend.”","The general sighed. ","“I could never win an argument against you Tim. Fine, I suppose this is how it is supposed to be.” He whistled audibly for people outside the room to hear. ","“Servants, please escort our guests here to their rooms.” He then addressed the party again. ","“Rest well tonight, for it may be our last.”","The general left the room and the servants arrived shortly after. Everything had been decided and all that was left to do was to face the might of the Warband. Their future had been left in fate’s hands and Tim’s strategy.","That night, most of the party found it hard to calm their nerves. Although they were all in separate rooms, they could feel each other’s presence. The night ran late, the candles burnt until they were stubs, so Tim lit the ceiling with a floating crystal ball. Hugh’s music dwindled until only soft notes echoed into the night. He rested against the wall and stared at the ceiling in pensive thought. His thoughts were of his mother, father and his home country. Before sadness could","grip him, he exited the palace to spend the night with Isabella. Saroza restrung her bow several times, just to make sure. Dig stayed in his room and practiced spell sculpting for the majority of the night, unable to sleep soundly.","~~~","Opposed to the scorching heat from the day, the freezing night out in the desert wasn’t too preferable either. Sir Styx and Robin could barely breathe as they remained in hiding, waiting for the enemy to pass. Finally, they could hear the marching of the Warband. Sir Styx clawed his way to the surface and pushed his fallen goblin kin aside. The sight of all the goblin corpses scattered on the ridge stirred something primal within him, but he forced himself to remain calm as he snuck in to the back lines of the enemy force. The goblins who spotted his arrival remained silent as the goblin warlord infiltrated the Warband and blended within their ranks.","The same could not be said for Robin. Unfortunately, the average kobold was not built for terrain such as the desert. Robin was no exception to this rule and as such, exited from his hiding spot very clumsily. As he emerged from the sand, the sudden blast of the frigid winds caused him to go into a coughing fit. Within moments, Hobgoblin Ironshadows surrounded the lone rogue.","Robin managed to squeeze out a few words. ","“Nice night for a stroll, hey fellas?”","“A spy?” One of the Ironshadows queried.","“Perhaps,” another said.","“Don’t think so. Kobolds aren’t found in the desert, it probably just lost it way.”","A round of laughter.","“It looks… awfully attractive doesn’t it?” One of the larger hobgoblins grinned from ear to ear to reveal a wide set of teeth. They were crooked and some were missing. Its breath was positively revolting. It sheathed its swords and bent over to talk to a shivering kobold. ","“I reckon you’d like it deep, wouldn’t you?”","“I-I-I don’t…” Robin stuttered.","“Bitch, sit down. Be humble.”","“No, please, no!” His screams echoed into the night, reaching Sir Styx’s ear among the forces below. Sir Styx cringed as he realised what was happening, but remained powerless to do anything.","The hobgoblin pulled its pants down and was inching ever closer to Robin. It removed its visor from its face, possibly to get a better look at the quivering rogue. ","“Fuck it, mask off.”","“Please, give me a chance. I’m not a spy or anything I’m just lost like you say,” Robin pleaded.","The Ironshadow grunted. ","“Fine, we will play a card game. If you win, then we will let you go. If you lose, I get to show you what it means to be a warrior.”","“How do I play?”","“Just pick the right card.”","“But you can cheat, right? Can’t we play snap or something?”","“I can let you play with something else, if you’d like.”","“Fine, cards then.” Robin agreed reluctantly, it wasn’t as if he had much of a choice in the situation.","The hobgoblin began shuffling a deck of cards as its peers looked on, goading Robin and frightening him further. Robin was certain that there was no way he could win legitimately. Hence, he tried his hand in cheating by reaching out to grab the cards. Whether it was the cold wind chilling his bones or the nerves coursing throughout his body, all he managed to do was clumsily trip over as he reached out for the cards. With an incredible stroke of luck, the hobgoblins felt so bad for the kobold that they let him live. However, he would have to serve as a mercenary in the force in return. That night, as the Warband marched forward, Robin revelled in the fact that he was still unsullied.","VII.","The party awoke to the sound of a soldier shouting at them from outside their rooms.","“Quickly my lords! The enemy have been spotted outside the walls! They will arrive here in about twenty minutes and General Gunas requests your presence at once!”","They were led out of the Maj Tahal and were exposed to the men, women and children that were unable to fight, rattling in fear. The Sultana, Gracy Trimshaw, walked around in an attempt to calm their nerves. She reassured them all that all would be well and that the heroes of Tyr would save them all. Bickman and the Boys were not so sure. She spotted the party and gave a quick nod before returning to her duties.","The journey from the palace to the outer walls did not feel as long as usual due to the adrenaline which was fuelling the party. Archers were stationed on the walls and the rest of the forces arranged as Tim had instructed. It was hard to stomach the tense atmosphere and it some of the soldiers were so stiff they were close to snapping. They spotted General Dilmah on top of the wall, who beckoned them to come up.","Atop the wall with General Dilmah, the party saw that even he himself was showing nerves. ","“Look at these","sleepyheads. I thought I’d have to fight these guys by myself at this rate. Sleep well?”","“Sleep is the cousin of death,” Tim said. ","“I don’t plan on dying here anyway. I’ll be sure to catch up on sleep after the battle.”","Dig, Hugh and Saroza nodded in unison.","“Indeed. Look to the horizon my friends.” The general pointed to the distance. ","“You can see them now, something a little over ten thousand as our reports suggested. Mercenaries in the frontline and harpies to the right. Musashi and Kur’Gash will not waste time in setting up their forces.” He turned to face the party, his face relaxing and sporting a small grin, one that echoed the resoluteness in his heart. ","“I guess this is it.”","~~~","Bickman and the Boys gathered around, surveying the battlefield and the soldiers lined up in perfect formation. Infantry formed a defensive line, cavalry supported the flanks and archers were positioned on the walls and in the rear to support. Saroza wondered how many of them would die today whilst trying to defend their home. She suppressed thoughts of happier times in the forest.","Dig turned to Tim. ","“Put some light behind me, wizard.”","Tim nodded and conjured a minor illusion behind the dragonborn.","“People of the Namati, listen closely!” Dig bellowed to the forces below. ","“Today we stand at the precipice between life and death! The enemies are numerous, bloodthirsty, savages! What do they know about the struggles of the valiant and righteous men of Galkoorlie?”","Dig’s words were starting to resonate with the majority of the soldiers and they were visibly less agitated.","He continued, “Do not fear what evil machinations the enemy has come up with! Your heroes are with you, as are your gods! Fight! Fight and live!” The forces of Galkoorlie responded with a mighty roar which shook the very foundations of the city. Their vibrant energy and revitalised sense of purpose were much needed in face of the approaching enemy. Bickman and the Boys raised their weapons to the air and cried back in unison. At this moment, they truly believed that they would triumph against adversity. Thump. Thump. Thump. Their voices were being drowned by the monotonous and foreboding beat of the enemy’s war drums. They were deathly close. Dig and Saroza scaled the walls to join the troops that were on the ground. Hugh and Tim remained at the top of the main gates to direct the battle alongside General Dilmah. All of them bear witness to the march of the mighty Warband. They could hear the enemy’s shouts and war chants which seem to be producing so much energy that their hearts almost burst out of their body. The","marching of this massive force conjured desert storms with pillars of sand spinning around like a maelstrom of impending doom. Some of the soldiers around them were puking onto the ground and others were shaking uncontrollably, causing them to drop their spears. ~~~ There they were. Ranks and ranks and ranks of hobgoblins clad in their splintmail looking solemn and firm, incredibly organised. Their mighty militaristic race was intimidating in and seemed to be making up the central section of the force. To their flanks were the orcs and bugbears. The orcs were as they had witnessed them before. Snarling, physically overpowering, green skinned warriors roaring at the top of their lungs for the Warband. The recent death of their champion, Keth Goblin-Gutter, appeared to have only fuelled their intense rage and bestial ferocity. To the other side of the hobgoblins the party could see what they presumed to be the bugbears. Saroza had seen one before but even she could not get over the beastly sight of these creatures. They looked like hairy, feral goblins and stood at over seven feet tall. Their eyes were greenish white with red pupils, and they had these wedge-shaped ears rising from the tops of their heads. The","poor quality armour they were wearing to protect their yellow-brown hides was unsightly and unsettling. The makeshift helmets over their heads barely covered their heads which were caked in thick, coarse brown hair. Approaching from behind them were four massive kodo beasts. Two in the middle seemed to belong to who they assumed to be the champions. To either side of them were are a strange looking orc and strange looking hobgoblin. In front of this main force were the mercenaries that the party had heard about. Several gnolls and a few lamia accompanied orc Warg-riders. The gnolls and even a few detachments of orcs were manning colossal siege towers which looked able to easily breach the fifty metre high walls of Galkoorlie. In the middle of all of this was a crudely made battering ram ridiculously large in size, maybe spanning about thirty metres in length and slowly being pushed by a group of orcs. In the air they could see a flock of bloodthirsty harpies gliding towards the wall, the sounds of their cries being physically sickening.","“General!” The hobgoblin champion, Musashi, yelled from across the field. ","“Surrender your walls and we will spare the women and children!”","“No, forget that!” The bugbear champion, Kur’Gash, rebuked. ","“Tear them apart! Rip them all! Take the young and elderly! No prisoners!” ","“This is ridiculous”, the party heard a soldier say. ","“We cannot fight this! They even have catapults behind them and… and giants!”","“Giants?” The soldiers started to whisper around themselves, the tension was rising once more. Indeed, behind the four massive kodo beasts to the very back was a group of ten giant humanoids. They had rich brown skin that was dressed in light robes which blended, essentially camouflaged, with the desert sand. On their bodies however, were these intricate tattoos in a riot of colours and patterns. The sight of these 17 foot tall fighters caused some of the soldiers to defecate themselves. Their instinct was to run and it was looking like some of the soldiers were actually considering doing so. The cries continued from the soldiers. ","“I have to see my family! Fuck this battle, it’s over!” ","“What about the heroes? We have them! Maybe they can win this?” ","“Fuck the heroes! I am living my last moments with my daughter!” General Dilmah roared with a fury that matched a dragon itself. ","“Men of Galkoorlie, hold your posts! You are brave and mighty men who stand even taller than the giants! If you are planning to run to your family and wait out the coming storm then you are not only a coward, but an absolute fool!” ","“That’s easy for you to say!” One of the voices respond back. ","“You don’t have a family to care for! You are sending us to our death!” ","“That is exactly what I am doing! Go on then, run back to your families! What then? Will you apologise to them that you ran when the enemy overrun us and enter the city?","Will you tell them how much you love them when your wives are fucked senseless by orcs? Will you tell your children that they are your greatest creations when they are sold to slavery and god knows what by the Warband?” The soldiers stood in shock. It was a good shock. The reality and truth of the situation set in. General Dilmah continued, “The heroes stand with us but you forget the most important thing of all! You are all heroes! Stand and fight with me brothers! You are the men of the Namati and righteous warriors of Galkoorlie! We shall know no fear! Strike true and I promise you we shall be victorious!”","The front ranks of gnolls and cavalry were now advancing towards the Galkoorlie forces, abandoning their siege equipment. They were preparing for a forward charge. But after the moving speech from the general, the Galkoorlie army was as ready as they’d ever be. Now, no more words needed to be said. The battle was about to begin.","VIII.","“Brace!” Dig commanded the left flank of infantry to hold their ground as Warg-riders and Lamia shock cavalry unleashed a devastating charge against the spearmen.","Spears were shattered. Shields were smashed. The momentum of the cavalry charge meant the deaths of many spearmen that day. However, the enemy cavalry had suffered even heavier losses. Some of the Warg-riders were immediately impaled by the defensive phalanx formation that Tim had proposed. The mounts and their riders were skewered and plummeted to the desert sand, then finished off by nearby swordsmen infantry. The sheer number of cavalry was enough to overwhelm some of the allied spearmen as they rammed straight into their position.","“Fire!” Tim gave the order from atop the walls to the archers.","Arrows rained down around Dig as he relinquished himself completely to the ethereal realm, becoming a conduit for magical obliteration. The sorcerer unleashed a torrent of searing wildfire which thrashed around violently, powered on by the scorching desert sun. It swirled and coiled around the enemy like a venomous viper as it smashed into the sides of the enemy and engulfed them in sweltering hellfire. The sight of the dragonborn and the inferno surrounding him was both an inspiring and horrifying sight to behold.","Even so, the enemy cavalry continued their charge. Alongside the defensive spear formation and the barrage of supporting archer fire from the walls, they were sure that they could hold off subsequent cavalry charges but for how long, they were not sure. Regardless, they would not be able to hold out forever.","~~~","The gnoll mercenary forces stormed forward towards the Galkoorlie infantry frontline. The soldiers braced themselves as they met their charge. Steel smashed against steel, shields and armour were shattered into shards. From atop the walls, Hugh could see the sands being soaked in crimson as friend and foe fell. Still, more arrows came raining down on the enemy as Tim calmly and coolly gave the orders.","Hugh and Tim continued surveying the battlefield. The left flank was holding off the advances from their cavalry but were slowly and surely getting worn out by their persistence. The centre was holding their own against the gnoll forces but behind them, advancing steadily, was the main Warband force. This worried Hugh, who prepared to climb down from the walls to assist.","Tim placed his free hand, the one not holding his crutch, on the bard’s shoulder and shook his head. ","“We need you here, Hugh.”","“I am worth more on the field. Have you seen what I can do with my rapier, mate?” Hugh boasted, although in jest.","Tim recognised the truth in his words but maintained, “It doesn’t matter if you can take down an enemy or two. You can see our situation, can’t you?”","Hugh groaned, “Oh for fucks sake, I know. We can’t hold them on the field forever, can we?”","General Dilmah stepped in and interjected, “We cannot. When the Warband makes contact with our lines, we will be overwhelmed with numbers alone.”","“Isabella…” The bard’s voice drifted off. He scanned the battlefield for her but she was nowhere to be seen.","Tim saw the anxiousness written on his companion’s face. ","“We are all going to make it.”","Hugh smiled. ","“Yeah… yeah, we are.”","Deafening screeches echoed from the skies to the east. Harpies were descending onto their position.","~~~","The archers of Galkoorlie were remarkably accurate but in spite of this, the harpies persevered. They swooped and manoeuvred through the air at lighting speeds and the archers struggled to keep them at bay. The wizard estimated there to be around 200 of these beasts. He knew that were they to make contact with the archers, their razor sharp claws would make short work of them.","Dilmah barked to the forces atop the wall, “Focus artillery and longbow fire on the harpies, they must not make it to these walls!”","Tim gripped his quarterstaff tight as he leant against his crutch to balance himself. They were very close now and they had possibly another fifteen seconds before they reached the walls. He closed his eyes and focused all of his arcane might into his quarterstaff. He chanted words of power which hummed in the air as the archers continued to fire at the harpies. The gem on Tim’s quarterstaff was glowing brilliantly and humming with power. Then with an almighty burst of crackling blue energy, Tim unleashed artillery of his own. Witchbolts streamed out of the staff as a vivacious stream of lightning energy struck the closest harpy and arced to its nearby allies. The screams of these monsters dying gave Tim a guilty satisfaction. Others were instantly vaporised by the Witchbolt while the other harpies’ central nervous systems shut down, causing them to lose consciousness and plummet to the sands below.","The strain on the wizard was great. Tim succumbed to fatigue and was forced to stop his concentration spell. Perhaps it was the lack of sleep or the injuries he had sustained, but he was unable to maintain his magic. He looked up once more to assess the situation. Although he had thinned out the harpies’ ranks, there were still around one hundred of them resuming their assault and swooping down fast.","“Why can’t you harpies ever be sexy?” Hugh screamed at the top of his lungs.","The harpies collided into the archers atop the wall and began ravaging the archers on the right side. Hugh watched as soldiers were gored and slashed apart by their mighty claws and chewed apart by their sharp beaks. Other archers were gripped by their talons and thrown over the fifty metre wall, the sound of their bodies impacting with the ground made the bard shudder.","The remainder of the archers continued shooting, urged onwards by the desperate survival struggle. Before the harpies could recover from the momentum of their charge, most of them were cut down by arrow fire and most died on the spot. But within moments of their initial landing they had already wiped out half of the archers and left a gaping hole in the allies’ defence. The handful of harpies that were not slain carried out a last ditch attack at Tim, Hugh and General Dilmah. The general sidestepped one of the harpies and lunged his longsword deep into the heart of the beast, all in a single motion. Tim was beginning to recover from his recent energy surge and once again focused his mind. The harpy met an explosive end mid-flight as the wizard shot a fireball at its feathery chest.","There was one more left, headed straight towards one of the archers. The archer frantically reached for another arrow as he had just fired, but he would not be able to draw in time. Hugh knew this and so charged to intercept the harpy before it could reach its prey. The bard vaulted into the air between the archer and the harpy, landing onto its back and whispering insults brimming with psychic energy into the creature’s ear. Distracted, the harpy was unable to stop the rapier which Hugh sent plunging straight through its heart. Its eyes rolled back and its wings stopped flapping, causing it to nose-dive right off the wall. Hugh failed to pull","his rapier out in time and was now doomed to a certain fate. He had saved a life but was headed straight to the ground.","The bard smiled to himself as he saw Tim frantically racing towards the edge of the wall and attempt to say the complicated magical words for the levitation spell. Being magically adept himself, however, Hugh knew that he wouldn’t be able to finish the spell in time. It was over. Or so he thought. As Tim and General Dilmah’s figures grew smaller and smaller on his free fall, he suddenly felt a rush of wind pierce the air. To be certain, there was nothing in the world that could fly with such alarming speeds… except for one. Pegasus. Pepe, who had been captured by the Warband prior, was now flying towards the bard and dove underneath him at the last second to scoop him up on its back. The incredulous expression on Hugh’s face was almost comical.","“Fuck me dead. This is a bloody miracle.” Hugh laughed to himself, unable to believe his own luck. ","“How did you even get here, Pepe?” The bard cast detect languages to communicate with the Pegasus, who revealed its escape from the Warband. ","“Incredible, you’re absolutely incredible. I’ll get the rest from you later. Right now my friend, we have a war to win.” Hugh grinned menacingly.","The Pegasus neighed mightily and flew upwards to land on the wall again alongside a stunned Tim and Dilmah.","“Hey boys,” Hugh said casually as he dismounted Pepe. ","“What’s the situation like down there?”","“See for yourself,” Tim replied.","Hugh peered downwards to the scene below. It was not pretty, and that was putting things lightly. He was deeply concerned for the party. ","“You know as well as I they cannot last much longer down there. They have to retreat, Tim.”","“I know.”","“Tim, we need to call them back.”","“I know.”","Tim turned to Dilmah. ","“We need to-”","“Holy shit!” Hugh exclaimed out of the blue. ","“Are you kidding me? Tim, look! At the back with the goblins, it’s Sir Styx and Robin!”","“Oh for fucks sake.”","IX.","Sir Styx, Robin and his goblin army waited patiently at the rear of the Warband forces. They were pushing the siege equipment forward but purposely doing it slowly in order to sabotage the enemy. In front of them to the left were the desert giants and to their right were the hobgoblin and bugbear champions alongside their two mages. Sir Styx knew they had to bide their time before they could strike but watching the battle unfold before them, it was obvious that they could not stay idle forever.","Robin was growing restless as he assisted some goblins in pushing one of the siege towers. He was an assassin, not a soldier. This was not where he wanted to be, with the cycle of life and death being so ever present around them. Death by giants or the Warband were not on his list of agendas for the day. Uncertainty started to plague the Robin’s mind. When would they attack? Would it be too late? Should he abandon all and save himself?","The goblin barbarian was not faring much better. He was deep in thought, which was rare for him, because of the many uncertainties of the situation. Even if he did not want to admit it, he cared deeply for his party members, especially Saroza. He also feared for the survival of the goblin forces assisting him in this operation.","“Sir Styx.” A voice echoed in his mind. ","“Sir Styx can you hear me?”","The barbarian broke his trance and looked around frantically. ","“Who is that?”","“Ah good. It’s me, Tim. Listen, I have a plan.”","~~~","Saroza’s arm was quickly growing tired. The strain of pulling her bladed bow, the Last Whisper, was making her extremely fatigued. Sweat was beginning to pour down from her hair over her eyes, obscuring her vision slightly. The enemy would not relent in their attack and there seemed to be no end to them. Although the gnoll mercenaries had been completely eradicated by the constant ranged fire, and the cavalry charges on the left were now becoming much more manageable, the enemy were still breaking through in the centre and on the right flanks.","The Galkoorlie cavalry had carried out some superb hammer and anvil strikes on the enemy but it wasn’t going to be enough. Saroza gazed forward a couple of hundred metres to spot Dig pirouetting on the battlefield like a dancer, sending out bolts of energy to strike the incoming horde. To her right, the infantry were getting decimated by the brutal bugbear shock troopers. The Galkoorlie cavalry was forced to retreat and their entire formation was beginning to be encircled. The half-orc ranger reached back into her quiver to pull another arrow out. She was out.","“Ha.” Saroza muttered under her breath. She had no more energy to complain. Her vision began getting cloudier and it took all of her willpower to remain standing on the sand. It was almost as if the battlefield was silent while she watched more and more soldiers falling left and right. The Galkoorlie army were retreating with backs to the wall","before the piles of bodies that created their own morbid landscapes.","This entire situation seemed surreal to the ranger, who had spent the majority of her life in the safe confines of the forest. If there was time, she would have sat there dreaming about the days she had spent hunting in the forest and learning from the wise druids there. Or the myriads of forest denizens that she had grown fond of. Instead, she picked up a sword lying on the ground beside her. She cleared her mind and in that moment, pictured only one thing. Survival. She cried out once more and rushed in to assist the right flank.","~~~","Dig pressed his hands against the throat of one of the orc warriors and focused his magical energies into the tips of Malvisier’s Gauntlets. This froze the orc’s throat and this ensured that it would die of asphyxiation. This was too inefficient for Dig. He drew his right arm behind his body and twisted his torso while cursing under his breath. Fuelled by anger and adrenaline his draconic claws slashed at the orc’s frozen throat, shattering it easily and leaving a gaping hole. Blood was spurting out of the wound like a faulty sprinkler, all over the sorcerer. Dig roared into the desert sky.","“Taste my magic, sorcerer!” A scream from beyond caused Dig to spin around to his front.","The orc mage who had been sitting at the back with the champions waved his staff in the air in elaborate sequences and emitted a powerful shockwave which caused enemies and allies alike to fall to their knees momentarily. Then, with its free hand it reached out towards Dig and cast a sphere of yellow energy. It shot towards Dig intended to make contact with his head. The dragonborn sorcerer recognised the spell instantly. It was a silencing spell meant to rupture his vocal chords and stop him from casting any more magic requiring verbal incantations. He was not going to allow that. Dig clasped his hands together and strange energy began conjuring between his gauntlets.","“You are not on my level, beast!” He screamed back, and blasted the yellow orb with his own magic, completely neutralising it dead in its tracks.","The orc mage grunted and retreated back to the rear, but not before casting a fog spell over the entire battlefield, which Dig also dispelled promptly.","“Amateurs!” Dig taunted as he slew another orc with a bonfire.","~~~","“Amateurs!” Sir Styx yelled at his goblin forces. ","“Faster you maggots or we’re all going to die at this point!”","They were committed to Tim’s plan. The goblins would use the siege equipment, including artillery pieces, to assault the enemy from behind. Robin and Sir Styx would","lead the charge and focus on alleviating the pressure from the right flank of the Galkoorlie forces. Unfortunately, even Tim could not account for the incredible resilience of the desert giants, who were now charging towards their position. Luckily for them, the champions and mages were assisting their forces in the middle of the battleground. This meant very little in the face of the giants though.","Five of the ten desert giants in the enemy force were surprised by the ballistae bolts poking out the front of their chest through their back. The remainder were not as easily taken down as they raised their scorpion carapace shields up in defence. The desert giants were now incredibly close. Sir Styx had ordered the goblins to scale the siege towers and leap onto the desert giants to shank them. This saw varied success. Three of the five giants were skewered by the swarm of goblins flying through the air. The other goblins were not so unlucky.","They screamed, “For the warlord!”","The giants swang their falchions. Then they screamed no more. The last two giants were still advancing on their position, and Sir Styx could now also spot a force of roughly two hundred bugbears coming in to assist them. The barbarian gritted his teeth. It was time to run.","The forces near the walls were now all but retreated, with only a handful remaining outside the walls. In order to ensure the safe retreat of their allies, a select few soldiers stayed behind to block the Warband. Arrows continued falling and blood continued dripping. The Warband realised their folly as the drawbridge was raised to lock them out. They had abandoned their siege equipment and were now caught in a torrential downpour of death. Seeing this, the hobgoblin mage created a dimension door and warped the","champions out of there. The orc mage refused and instead, rushed towards Sir Styx and Robin out of spite.","Without pause the last of the two desert giants picked up gigantic boulders from the ground and with all their immense strength, lobbed it straight at the fifty retreating goblins. Robin and Sir Styx turned their heads back to see the battle hungry bugbears and the massive rocks plummeting down towards them.","“What now, Styx?” Robin exclaimed frantically as he brandished his revolvers, Mercy and Retribution. He shot a few rounds into the desert giants but this only managed to put a small dent in their shields.","With the boulder hurtling towards the barbarian’s kin, the situation was looking grim. Sir Styx would not and could not allow this. He sheathed his boar blade and let out a long, deafening warcry at his foes, all fear and doubt leaving his body. His eyes and skin grew a radiant gold which blinded everyone nearby while his canines enlarged further. His appearance was feral and boar-like, his will and ferocity unmatched. The barbarian’s veins pulsated and his pulse quickened beyond the limit of common mortals so he was not able to maintain a steady breath. Robin and the surrounding goblins were speechless as froth began forming around his snarling mouth.","“SIR STYX SMASH!”","All of his common sense escaped him as he sped with unnatural velocity. He bounced off one of the goblins","to end up high in the sky, in the flight path of one of the boulders. The first boulder shattered against his bare chest and throbbing muscles, exploding into tiny fragments and shards of stone. The barbarian did not even flinch. The second boulder came flying down moments later but this time Sir Styx caught the boulder mid-flight before it landed. He roared and lobbed the boulder towards the desert giant, who ducked just in time to avoid its head being taken clean off. But still, the enemies pressed forward.","Meanwhile, Robin was on the ground panting for breath. The orc mage had cast a fireball at his position and were it not for the assassin’s keen senses, he would have been crisped. He arched his blades and sliced through the arcane missiles spiralling towards him. He tumbled and dodged and suddenly appeared behind the mage, slicing his throat.","“What… how?” The orc mage managed to sputter out as blood was spraying from his throat.","“Bitch, sit down. Be humble.”","X.","Sir Styx and Robin had no choice but to retreat from the bugbears and desert giants. His rage having subsided, Sir Styx was forced to oversee the tactical withdrawal. They were not aware that the battle at the walls of Galkoorlie had been won. The Galkoorlie army had managed to withdraw to the city and closed out the Warband, who were basically sitting ducks. They were too busy trying to escape with their very lives to even register this. Robin tripped. It was over. There was no way in all the nine hells that they could escape the inevitable onslaught.","Sir Styx stopped dead in his tracks to help his kobold friend up. ","“We’ve been through so much together, man.”","Robin got up to his feet with his friend’s assistance. ","“Yeah.”","“We can’t outrun them, hey?”","“Probably not.”","Sir Styx’s throat was coarse from thirst and all the running that they were doing but he managed to let out a chuckle. ","“You have any regrets, old friend?”","Robin nodded and flourished his dual daggers. ","“No. You?”","“All I have ever wanted,” Sir Styx unsheathed his boar blade and turned around to face the incoming horde, “is to be remembered.”","The dynamic duo prepared for their last charge against overwhelming odds but halted as they heard a very familiar sounds. It was Hugh riding atop his Pegasus.","~~~","The Warband at the outer walls were in full retreat. Tim had no room for mercy in his heart, not after what he had seen. He ordered the archers and artillery to continue firing at will at the defeated Warband forces. This battle was all but won, except there was still one final challenge. Sir Styx and Robin’s escape.","Tim turned to General Dilmah. ","“Dilmah, do we have any more camels? Please, tell me you do.”","The general shook his head sombrely.","“Our friends… they’re going to…”","“They’re not going to do shit, mate!” Hugh shouted while mounting on the Pegasus. ","“I got this.”","As the bard and his flying horse dove off the wall and began to ascend into the air, Tim shouted back at him. ","“You’re crazy!”","The last words that Tim heard from Hugh as he got further away from the walls was, “You mad, brother?”","~~~","Hugh ducked as a boulder missed his head by mere inches. He could scarcely believe the unnatural accuracy of these desert giants since he was so high up in the sky. This hardly","mattered though. He was intent on saving his friends. Sir Styx and Robin weren’t going to make it without his help and Hugh was not having anyone die under his watch.","Another boulder came flying in. Because they were taking a direct flight path straight towards the retreating goblins, there was little room even for Pegasus to dodge. It would be a direct hit.","“Fuck,” Hugh cursed under his breath.","Just before the boulder hit, Hugh drew his Warp Fang, the celestial arm that was gifted to him by the sphinxes. Concentrating his will, he pressed against the hilt of the dagger. Time around the bard froze and it looked like a bubble of space had materialised around the entire battlefield. It made him feel nauseous. Something was strange. His heart had stopped beating. He let go of the hilt of the dagger and time around him rewound. Everything in the last six seconds was reversed. This time, Hugh would not make the same mistake.","Hugh barely managed to land safely as he reached Sir Styx and Robin’s position. There was not much time left. The fifty or so goblins were aiding in their warlord’s escape by charging into the enemy. The both of them could not even fathom that Hugh had flew all the way here.","Hugh offered an outstretched hand. ","“Come with me if you want to live!”","Sir Styx and Robin jumped onto the back of Pegasus without any hesitation.","“Fly, Pepe!” Hugh shouted majestically.","Pepe could not move. Hugh’s heart sank to his stomach. Pepe wouldn’t be able to support the weight for the three of them. He wasn’t certain, but he was sure that","Robin and Sir Styx figured out the problem as well. Memories of his parents and hometown came flooding to his mind again, of a time when he was truly happy. He also remembered the night that he spent with Isabella and wondered whether she was still alive in this whole nightmare. He dismounted Pepe and drew his rapier out.","Sir Styx’s mouth was agape as he asked, “What are you doing?”","“I…” Hugh choked back some tears, coming to the realisation that this would be his final moment. ","“I’m just going out for a stroll, my friend.”","Both Sir Styx and Robin were speechless. They understood what the bard was proposing but they could not allow their friend to die in their place, so they prepared to dismount the Pegasus. Hugh placed his hands on the both of them and forced them down onto Pepe. His eyes glowed a pinkish hue one more and he charmed the two into submission. Then, he slapped the rear of Pepe, which prompted it to take off and fly towards the walls.","“Be safe, now. Take care of Pepe for me.” His voice drifted into the winds as he watched them fly off to safety. He took a flute out from his pocket and played a little tune to calm his nerves. His hands were trembling and his heart was beating out of his chest, yet in his mind all was clear. As the bugbear forces were now around thirty feet away from him, he dropped his flute and gripped his rapier tightly.","He pierced the heart of the first bugbear. ","“You.” He jabbed the eye of the second bugbear. ","“B.” He finished off a third bugbear with a vicious mockery. ","“Mirin.”","TO BE CONTINUED…"]

Dig is branded a traitor by the mirror, but the party refuse to believe that Dig would betray them. After all, he has proven loyal and a good leader for the time being, so they argued that the mirror may be faulty.

A particular interesting theory that Musashi makes is that the pyramids built in the Namati desert were supposedly designed by some extraplanar or extraterrestial beings. He surmises that these very same beings were responsible for pyramids in several other desert terrains on other worlds. Humans and green skins used to coexist, but the diminishing resources eventually led to racism and war.", "d) After this history lesson, Musashi gives some more gifts to the party (The GM is trying really his best to make a likeable character lmao).

In the event that he dies, he asks Dig to look after Yuki and to be in charge of the hobgoblin people until Yuki is of age", "e) The party enjoy themselves at the festival. Sir Styx gets down and dirty with the Ironshadows in their hideout, performing acrobatic stunts with them while drinking ten times his body weight. Dig has almost a whole cask of sake to himself as he sits contemplating inside the tea house. Rufus decides to use his free time (he was supposed to be supervised by Sir Styx, but the goblin obviously ran off and decided to get hammered) to go to the gambling den, where he wins big.

I can give you all of this and more, all you need to do is bend the knee and be my tools. What do you say?”", "> Saroza smiles wryly. ", "> “Really?”", "> Tim’s reply has a clear venom in his voice as his eyes burn an electric blue that glean in the dark.

You will learn of the power of Beezelbub and the never ending call that is Gluttony!” ", "> And with an almighty roar that shakes the foundations he sends his colossal right arm straight at you! Roll for initiative. ", " ~~~", "> The fight was fucking intense yo. ", "> First phase: The party figured out pretty quickly that they needed to destroy the tubes connecting to Beezelbub (they were providing sustenance to him via the creatures in the vats). Beezelbub grows four spectral arms and basically sends a flurry of punches at Tim, who is hiding behind a pillar. The pillar instantly disintegrates with the brunt force as does the number of mirror images that surround Tim. Were it not for the illusions conjured by him, he would have been absolutely and utterly crushed by the force of these blows. Saroza and Dig continued to provide support fire as Sir Styx charged in and sliced a gaping hole into Beezelbub’s belly, he then hopped in. Although Tim is eventually charmed by Beezelbub, this spell is quickly dispelled due to him being distracted by the goblin hopping around in his belly. In defeat, Beezelbub roars and smashes the ground, causing the entire party to hurtle to the next floor. Thankfully for Sir Styx, he managed to crawl out of the stomach in time and avoided taking any fall damage due to his cape of berserk (feather fall fucking op)", "> Second phase: The demon grows four more legs and scuttles around like a cockroach, oh yeah and he also gets two more heads. He bullcharges Sir Styx and almost knocks him off the platform that they are all on but the barbarian with pure miraculous strength (nat 20) he rips off one of the heads of the beast and sends it flying. In retaliation, Beezelbub splits himself into many copies around the room but these are destroyed by the numerous attacks from the party. Once this form is defeated the party actually fall the entire way to the bottom floor (the refrigeration room)", "> Third phase: The demon’s final form was like a six pack demon knight god thing, looked fucking beautiful tbh but also incredibly fast and strong. With his spectral greataxe, he knocked Sir Styx out, actually leaving a long gash on the side of Sir Styx’s face and over his left eye. ", "> Beezelbub’s final attack was a magic missile meant to end Tim’s life and for a moment, it looks like it succeeds as the magic missiles completely annihilate the wizard. But to Beezelbub’s shock, and Tim’s amusement, they actually struck one of the images of Tim. With all of his final energy, Tim sends out a barrage of missiles of his own and these end the demon’s life.", "> The party have killed Beezelbub. They have slain the demon of Gluttony. They have felled the Warlord of the Warband. Holy fucking shit boys.", "> TO BE CONTINUED..."]

Musashi and a female ironshadow arrive, drenched in sweat. Sir Styx recognises the female ironshadow as Sakura, and recalls drinking with her while he was in Napaj. Musashi looks quite drained, and the reason is because as you look down, you notice his right arm from the elbow downwards is missing. ", "> Musashi notices you staring and grimaces as he says, “You saw what happened to those with the demon blood in them. Losing an arm to stop the flow was nothing compared to the pain I put our people through. Still… I never thought I’d see the day. How many suffered because of my lack of foresight. None dared stand against the demon yet here lays his rotting remains. A goblin, a human, a halforc and a dragonborn, not quite what I envisioned as a band of heroes but… you give hope to this old man.” Musashi gets on his knees and with great effort he bows with his head pressed firmly against the stone foundations. Sakura continues trying to bandage the stump that is still dripping with blood but he pushes her away with his remaining arm. ", "> “Ah forget about me, give them the letter.”", "> Sakura nods and steps to Dig, handing him this rolled up parchment. It is closed with a seal that has a skull and a dagger in one of the eyes. ", "> Musashi says, “We received that letter shortly after you left for your infiltration mission. Judging by that seal, it’s safe to say that’s from the antipathy but I know very little about them.”", "> You open up the letter and it seems to be written by Ked himself. It seems that he is dedicating the majority of his resources on finding Dustin Hoggman after he ran off with Solution Ultima. However, he has an even more disturbing piece of information. Hugh Mirin’s body is missing from the crypt… he ends the letter by wishing you luck for your journey and to accept this gift.", "> Dig’s brow furrow. “Gift?”", "> Sakura comes up to Dig and hands him what looks like a regular bell. On this bell are smooth engravings that completely cover its whole body. As you Dig, take it into your hands you feel almost invigorated with a strange energy.", ">Musashi adds, “The messenger said that you should ring the bell when you need assistance. But that it only had three uses so use it wisely.” ", "> “I see that you’ve found your friends too. I’m happy for you. Judging by the look on the girl’s face I’d say that she will wake in a few days. Your dwarven friend however, hmm… no guarantees there I’m afraid.”", "> Sir Styx laughs and bellows. “No worries there!”", "> Musashi gives you one last smile.", "> “Anyway, this looks like where our paths diverge. I would have liked us to all go to Napaj and celebrate with a great feast but obviously there is still work to be done. I will take my people to North Australis after meeting up with the Namati and West Australis forces. I’m sure the sultan and sultana will be overjoyed to hear the good news. By the way Saroza, do I have your permission to lead the orcs for the time being until we meet up one more?” ", "> Saroza nods.", "> “Thank you. As for your journey you will be talking to the elves in Udakak forest. No one really knows about how to get there because they are even more isolated than the Namati people. The forest is dense and quite vast, but you are travelling with a ranger so you will not get lost. I’d say your best bet is to head to Grelivia first.” Musashi shows you where the location of this is on the map. ", "> “It is a human village of lumberjacks and traders just outside the Udakak forest. If anyone knows about how to contact the elves it is them. Be careful, especially you Tim, they don’t like humans very much. The rest of your party are outside this camp. I’ve loaded up some food and water for the rest of your trip, it should only be a couple of days at most. But we’ve dawdled long enough now.” Musashi bows deeply again before turning around and saying for the last time for a long while, “Farewell.” ", "> And then he leaves, with Sakura following closely behind. She gives Sir Styx a wink and disappears. You haven’t seen Sir Styx’s pants any tighter.", "> On the Road", "> Moving along, your party takes around two full days to finally make it out of the desert and along the way you take note of the changing scenery. The sun is just starting to rise on the third day of your travel and bits of dew glean on the blades of grass engulfing the green plains that you are currently in. Sir Styx is quite tired from the ride here and Saroza is quite tired of Sir Styx’s constant advances but you are both quite calmed by the sounds of birds chirping in the air and you can just barely make out the sounds of some other woodland creatures out in the very, very far distance where the Udakak forest is now in sight. To your right hand side you finally see the Cronana freeway once more and a return to a more civilised setting. As Dig and Tim are discussing matters of the arcane, they are suddenly interrupted by Auron who is making little yelping noises and flapping his wings in excitement. You all spin around and to your amazement… Lux has finally awoken. Grundle leaps off Dumbo’s back and your whole party stops for the time being as Grundle helps Lux to her feet and off the cart.", "> She is still in a slight daze as she looks around and asks, “What happened to Beezelbub? Are you real? Are we dead?”", "> Explains about how she survived. Sorry about the dead George, Lucas, and Arts. Ask about Hugh Myrin’s fate and how is Auron? ", "> Asked about Tim’s foot and says that she knows about an automail expert in North Australis, a gnome. She also wants to speak to him in private but not right now because right now she is extremely famished (unfortunately there is no food on the cart so they need to find some lodgings) ", "> They come across an inn that they never noticedbefore. Inside, the bartender is named Binker and offers them rooms for the night but at a very hefty price. He warns the party of the perils in the forest at night but the party largely remains carefree. They drink the day away and wait until night when Binker locks the inn and goes upstairs. Lux is with Tim upstairs, along with Robin and Grundle. The animal companions are all outside grazing next to a bonfire conjured by Dig. ", "> Night strikes and suddenly the party find themselves in the same tavern but extremely dark with a strange puzzle revolving around lasers and shapes. (pretty fucking genius puzzle if I might add, fuck me Darren you’re amazing)", "> When they finally solve the puzzle and escape, the inn disappears before there very eyes and everyone is sleeping on the ground.

Eventually allow to let them in but warn that things are pretty tense", "> 3. Sir Styx visits the jousting arena and destroys their best knight, Sir Lancealot (lel), getting some silver pieces in the process. Saroza has a look at the training yard but finds nothing interesting, except that the soldiers are all training without any weaponry", "> 4. Their leader, called Old Man Fenrir is fishing but not catching much (comments on how the catches have been really crappy of late). Dig gets the party to meet up and they talk about business.", "> 5. Reveals things about how going to the elves is hard because even though they’ve lived in relative peace with each other, we’ve recently been quite tense and one bad word away from a full on war. Trade carts have been attacked indiscriminately and not from the Dirlagraun (displacer beast) or Feral Ones either (rogue werewolves). Why do you even want to visit the elves anyway? ", "> 6. Says no one really knows how to really get to the Banksia World tree where the elves’ home is said to be except for the elves themselves or other fey folk. Lux reminds them that they desperately need to reach the banksia world tree because the elves have the ancient magic probably that can heal Thorin", "> 7. Offers an idea, venture into the Udakak forest and escort a trade caravan filled with meats and wines to the other side and hopefully they’ll find the elves they’re looking for. Simply must travel through one of the paths that us humans made through it to get to the north, should only take three days tops. Perhaps they can diplomacies or even deal with them more… lethally", "> 8. They all set forward for their journey into the Udakak after buying some supplies", ">Udakak forest", "> 1. They travel and the four guards with them plus trade caravan driver for a couple of hours", "> 2. Night falls around this time and they are ambushed (elves?) but turns out to be some sort of stalking predator... THE DIRLAGRAUN FUCK", "> 3. Caravan guards, all four are dispatched instantly and the party are essentially all downed the same way. They cannot keep up with the speed of this creature as it blends in the night, and every strike it lands sends the party teleporting several feet away from their initial positions. ", "> 4. As Dig is about to be dealt the killing blow,flaming arrows are shot at it from above and it slinks back into the dark. ", "> 5. The elves suddenly appear from behind all the trees with arrows trained on the party.", "> They are yelling in Elvish, which Tim luckily understands due to his numerous years studying arcane tomes (Elven magic is one of the most common and foundational types of magic in Thera)", "> “ Selama ashal'anore” (Justice for our people)", "> “Bash'a no falor talah!” (Taste the chill of true death!)"]

                    "It is dark but the moon’s silver light gently illuminates this small section of forest that you’re in. Aside from the trees and a small gathering of fireflies, there is little but the corpses of the caravan guards, ravaged beyond recognition by this terrible beast that just assaulted you, their lifeblood slowly seeping into the soil and staining the surroundings in dark crimson. As you help each other onto your feet, or foot in Tim’s case, you hear sounds of what you first mistake for as the scampering of woodland creatures across the forest floor, or perhaps even the rustling of foliage as they are disturbed by the winds. But you soon realise that these noises are from the movements of some figures above you, atop the trees in the towering branches. It is the sound of several arrows being nocked onto longbows. How many are you not sure…",
                    "You hear hushed whispers and can just barely make out some of these figures. One of the elves is clearly a woman, which you can tell by her lady-like characteristics. She is slender, petite, but Saroza knows the strength it takes to pull the strings of one of these longbows so her strength is definitely not of question. Her silver locks glisten in the moonlight as her head turns to gaze at each of you in turn as if analysing you.",
                    "She says to one of her elven comrades perched on another branch, “Anar’endal dracon, could these really be them?”",
                    "The elf who responds is bald and has extremely pointy ears even for elven standards. You doubt anyone has said that to his face though because this elf is extremely well-built and stocky. “I do not know, but if any of them draw their Zaram, questions will not be necessary.”",
                    "Another elf now who is situated on the closest branch to you all, drops to the ground with his bow still aimed directly at you, stepping closer for a better look. You can see that this elf is quite handsome, he has golden hair and perfectly symmetrical features, something which aggravates Sir Styx to no end. At first glance, he looks like those stereotypical pompous elves you’ve read about in books, he seems to be alert and composed before you. ",
                    "The bald elf speaks to this handsome elf, “Arthalas, these may be the ones that the Ancient One spoke of.”",
                    "This elf, presumably Arthalas stops dead in his tracks and lowers his bow slowly. There’s a graceful lilt to his voice which is gentle but firm. His eyes lock onto Dig as he says, “you are Sin’dracon, blood of the dragon. Neither here nor there. Why are you here so far from your people?”",
                    "Dig responds, “I’m sort of here on an adventure of some sorts, I suppose. Just a bit of sightseeing, that’s all.”",
                    "Arthalas continues, “ Anaria shola greenskins, are you not also of the desert? You may fancy yourself a ranger, girl, but I presume you are less skilled than our young. As for you goblin, what do you have to say yourself as you carry around those… severed heads on your belt? Do you mean to cause trouble, outsider?”",
                    "Without hesitation, Sir Styx nods. “Yes we-”",
                    "Tim pulls Sir Styx back a small distance. “No we aren’t.”",
                    "Saroza remains silent but steadfast as she watches the elves.",
                    "The elf also looks over briefly at the rest of your party but he doesn’t seem to be too interested in Lux and Grundle, or your animal companions. The rest of the elves do stare slightly longer at Pegasus though, sort of admiring this beautiful mare. Thankfully, Auron is hiding inside the party caravan so the elves don’t seem to have noticed him either. Unfortunately, the stare that Arthalas is giving to Tim doesn’t seem entirely friendly.",
                    "“Ugh, a human, or should I say a Kim’jael, little rat. We saw you all travelling from Grelivia together. So, has this crippled human man poisoned your minds as well? Are you all here to cause MORE trouble for our people on the behalf of that forsaken lycanthrope-infested hovel?” ",
                    "Tim shakes his head. “Whatever has happened between our people in the past, there are now more important matters to discuss.” The wizard explains their situation and their task from Grelivia, as well as the demon threat posed by Lucifer. ",
                    "The elves listen silently. When Tim is finished speaking, Arthalas looks over to the rest of the elves, who nod in unison. They seem to be satisfied with your answer and one by one they descend from the trees, bows holstered on their backs. Because of their black hide armour, they are seemingly camouflaged with the night sky as they fall, well, float to the ground. Before you are now seven elves in similar armour and equipment. You noticed the female elf and the bald elf, but there also three others you haven’t seen. These three look identical to each other and there seems to be no way you could tell them apart unless you had magical means. ",
                    " Arthalas speaks once more. “In truth, we have watched you since your arrival in Grelivia. You see, we were sent by the Ancient One who foretold of your coming. The Ancient One also told our people terrible news, that there is a demon threat from one named Lucifer. Her eminence claimed that you were the heroes that banished the demon of West Australis and slew one in the Namati Desert. How much of this is true?”",
                    " Tim nods. “Most of that is true.”",
                    "“Most?”",
                    "“Well, you say banished but to be honest we don’t really know what we did to the first demon, the Prince of Plagues.”",
                    "“That being said,” Dig interjects, “those threats have been dealt with. Now here we are about to ask-”",
                    "“For our assistance?” Arthalas turns his head to face the other elves and then back to the dragonborn. “Unfortunately, that is not a decision that we can make, we will have to bring you to the Ancient One herself, that was her task for us after all. Perhaps the druidic circle will also have their input in this.” ",
                    "“More druids, fuck me. I am sick of those bastards,” Sir Styx says as he kicks the dirt with his feet.",
                    "“Um, er anyhow, I ask for your forgiveness for my… brashness earlier. It’s no secret that there is no love lost between my kind and the humans, and the fact that my people have been attacked regularly by the werewolf scum at Grelivia doesn’t help.” ",
                    "Tim bow slightly in response, his missing foot making it quite a strain.",
                    "“But I see that there are more important matters afoot (pardon the pun). But why, where are my manners, I haven’t introduced us properly. My name is Arthalas, the leader of the Scout Regiment. You will find no better hunters in the Udakak forest. My dalah’surfal, or as you would say in common, my wife, her name is Tyrande. The bald one’s name is Dom, and the three triplets: Tic, Tac, and Toe. What about all of you?”",
                    " The party introduce themselves in turn. ",
                    "Tyrande, the female elf, steps forward and asks you. “The Ancient One said that that you were all travelling with… well… I can hardly believe it but she says that you are travelling with a Dracon, the very last of its kind. Can we… see it?”",
                    "Bickman and the Boys are hesitant. The safety of Auron was paramount and simply showing it to strangers was not not high on their list of things to do for the day. ",
                    "“I don’t know what you’re talking about to be honest.” Dig lies through his teeth. It is not very convincing.",
                    "“Look,” Arthalas steps in, “if you know anything about Australis and the elves then you will know full well the reverence that our people have with the dragons. It was the draconi that we worshipped before the first men came and the Ancient One has already told us that a dracon is here. Please, my friends.”",
                    "Tim doesn’t like the idea but he is an intelligent man and recognises that this could be an opportunity to build trust between their groups. “Very well. Grundle, let them see him.”",
                    "Grundle, who has been sitting silently next to Robin and Lux on the caravan, nods his head and unveils a basket in which Auron has been grazing. Like a small puppy, it cheerfully bounces around until it reaches the ground, straight towards Dig’s open arms. It looks at the elves momentarily before resting itself in the dragonborn’s grasp.The elves, immediately at witnessing the golden creature, fall to their knees and bow with their heads planted firmly against the ground. Around thirty seconds go past after they get back to their feet, but in their eyes you can still the awe that they hold for Auron.",
                    "Dom stutters, “Your d-d-dracon, what is its name?”",
                    "Dig pats the dragon’s head as he announces, almost proudly, “His name is Auron.” ",
                    "The elves smile, it is almost as if they have become filled with colour, with hope. “Hail Auron, anu belore dela’na.”",

                    "2. ",
                    " Arthalas speaks once more, “Enough small talk. Let me lay out what’s going on here. You said you wished to get the elves support with the demon threat. I may not be the leader of our people, but I will also not willingly send them to an early grave. So I ask you, what exactly is your plan? Do you think this is some sort of game where we march to the enemy and seize the day? Let’s assume you do have support of elven kind, and we march alongside as allies towards Arcabern. What hope do mortals have against beings from hell?”",
                    "“All hope, my brother!” Sir Styx exclaims. “Demonkind has no chance against me and my lovely lady, Saroza.”",
                    "Saroza grunts in disgust. ",
                    "“Honestly, we have very little hope,” Tim admits. “However, there is no point dwelling on that stuff. Many will die I am sure, but if we do not try then our doom is certain.”",
                    "“Such a way with words my friend has.” Dig crosses his arms and steps closer towards Arthalas, staring straight into his pupils. “The people of Australis must band together, there is no such thing as elves against humans or whatever other petty conflict we have had in the past. Right now, it is the very survival of the living which is important. Are you with us or are you against us?” ",
                    "Everyone’s eyes are fixed on the dragonborn’s gauntlets, which are lightly clenched into a fist. ",
                    "Arthalas shrugs. “In any case, as I said before this decision isn’t mine to make. It’s just that...”",
                    "Tyrande steps forward and places a hand on Arthalas’ shoulder, which seems to calm him instantly. “My love, our task is to take these heroes to the Ancient One. They look like they are ronae, peaceful... except maybe this goblin here. But regardless, dalah’surfal, we must band together in these trying times. Please.”",
                    "“You are right, as always.” He smiles. “The scout regiment will take you all to the Banskia World Tree as the Ancient One requested. I will have some of my other men escort your caravan later, rest assured that it will make it safely into North Australis. Also, the rest of your party except for you four I’ll have others escort them too using the safer path but they will arrive a day later than us. Do not worry, they are in safe hands.”",
                    "“That’s what we thought last time.” Tim says. “No, that’s not happening. We travel together or not at all.”",
                    "“Foolish kim’jael, I would expect nothing less than stubbornness from a human. Let me tell you this, with you already missing a foot, we are slowed down considerably. Apart from your ranger you are all like infants in this forest. Considering you have an... elephant, well we will simply lose too much time.”",
                    "“Then we shall lose time.” Tim says coldly.",
                    "Lux calls to Tim teasingly, “It’s because you’re just going to miss me aren’t you?”",
                    "The wizard doesn’t break stride. “Hardly, it’s just that I have so many poems that I’ve got it would be a waste on this lot.”",
                    "“Enough.” Arthalas takes a step closer to Tim. “I will tell it to you straight, there are known dangers in the Udakak forest like the Dirlagraun which we just faced and the Feral Ones, who are a pack of a rogue werewolves from Grelivia. But there also dangers out here, especially in the dark, that even we of the forest do not know. Travelling together would spell certain death, we would be too slow.”",
                    "Dig steps in to break the two apart before they can get to each other’s throats. “Look, how about you have some of your men escort Dumbo separately while the rest of us travel together. That way, we still have the security of numbers while still being able to move swiftly.”",
                    "Arthalas considers the dragonborn for a moment, looking towards his wife for support, who nods. He lets out a sigh of exasperation as he turns to face his back to you. “Very well, stay close and do not fall behind. We can’t guarantee your safety.” ",
                    "The party agree and prepare to head off with the elves. Sir Styx starts casting his Speak with Animal spell as he walks, essentially dancing as they travel. Before Bickman and the Boys press forward, they hear Arthalas remark. “A full moon. We shall not rest this night.”",

They came across an injured owlbear, which Saroza managed to befriend and in doing so, gained herself a young giant owl as a companion. Then, they were all pursued by the mighty dirlagraun, forced to seek shelter within a cave. It was in this cave that Sir Styx found the gauntlets of berserk and your party supposedly discovered the ancient artefact that the elves refer to as the Eye of Melora. Following a battle with millions of ettercaps and spiderlings you all manage to escape the cave to arrive at a gorge. There is a bridge to the other side but as you were all battered and bruised, decided to rest and catch your breath. Unfortunately this is when the bridge suddenly gets cut and the party found themselves surrounded by the Feral Ones, the pack of rogue werewolves roaming the Udakak Forest. After some brief parleying, one of the werewolves gave the party an ultimatum. Stay with the elves and die or run and forever hold your peace.

You remember who you are, or at least you remember who you think you are. You are Tim of Felbourne, a mighty wizard, renowned for his studies into the arcane. You are a master, aren’t you? You are bombarded with a series of images that flash before your eyes and end up disappearing just as quick, a reel of experiences and emotions that flicker before you and ignite lost thoughts lurking within the deep recesses of your mind. You see a rift in the sky which glows an eerie green and emanates a dark aura, monstrosities and abberations forcing their way through this newly formed chasm, accompanied by howls and cries that fall on deaf ears. Are they your memories? You’re not sure. But for some reason you feel empty. You feel… lonely. And then… you feel nothing.",

You have to be dreaming, none of this can be real and yet this feels more than real, feels more real than anything you’ve experienced. In the distance you can sense three other presences that gently fade into existence. You recognise them instantly as your companions; Dig, Saroza and Sir Styx. Your spirits form a circle and inside this circle are three fruits that you have never seen before but they look so delectable and desirable. It is as if you’ve wanted for them your whole life. Subconsciously you begin to reach out to these fruits and as you make contact you are filled with what can be described as total bliss, contentment, you feel whole again. But something malevolent stirs within the darkness. A serpent-like creature as black as the void and lined with glowing red now materialises and it begins swirling around you in large arching movements. Its long forked tongue hisses at you as it draws closer but what you notice is that in its eyes are balls of glowing light. They are your souls. Somehow, you understand that this creature wishes to destroy you all. Somehow, you realise that you must eat these fruits whole to survive. But there are only three fruits and four of you. Three will survive while the other will perish. Time is running out. ",

There also seems to be someone within the World Tree, saying they were waiting for people, for the heroes.", "-Arthalas follows the druids to discuss the meeting, leaving Tyrande to let the party explore the city", "~~~", "Exploring the City", " 1. The Lake- sacred healing waters. The party all take a dip in here. Tyrande goes in fully naked, which arouses Sir Styx. He flirts with the elf but she threatens to tell Arthalas, saying that he would easily best the barbarian. There are carp, bass, bream, catfish, sparkling lights, some hunters are spear fishing on the other side of this lake, and in the middle of it all is the actual World Tree itself (city is called Banksia World Tree but the actual World Tree is the thing that provides sustenance to all surrounding buildings). Tyrande explains that the lake is pretty ordinary without the ancient one using her magic. ", "2. Hunter Hall-party leave Thorin here with Grundle. Lux and Tim decide to walk out together and explore the rest of the city. This hunter hall is apparently the headquarters for the scout regiment and different trophies of different game are displayed on the walls. Dom meets the party here and explains that they couldn’t get access to the temple to give them accommodation so they could just stay here. Tyrande tells Dom to take the party for more exploration of the city because she has gotten fed up with Sir Styx. Grundle goes to Ancient of War to rebuild hookshot for Sir Styx.", "3. Ancient of Lore- inside there is an old librarian (grey hair, curly mustache, slender and frail elf librarian) named Andruin, who is simply minding his own business until the party barge in. They insist that this elf’s name is Clive and are extremely close to induce identity crisis on the poor man. Sir Styx begins to rewrite goblin history literally with a quill and velum. Andruin is asked many questions by the party. He reveals that he has many stories to tell, such as the history of the elven people and the old kingdom of Attadale and the lost civilisation of the Badlands. Unfortunately this doesn’t interest the party and they ask about very mundane things instead. Dig however, is interested about whether there are any stories about a legendary beast in the ocean. Andruin shows him that he himself has a black bible which was given to him by dragon cultists that existed a thousand years ago when he was 60 years old. He tells him that the beast in the water is probably one of a pair of legendary satanic beasts from another plane. Leviathan and Behemoth.", "4. Ancient of War- disused, the elven army was abolished by the druids a hundred years ago and only the hunters remain.", "5. Merchants Lodge-shopping everywhere. Saroza decides to go to a stall that is selling arrows; fire arrows and a special unknown arrow. Dig insinuates that this shop owner stole from them and they proceed to steal everything that the elf owns. He runs away crying. They then go to a stall at the very back selling what is called ‘cocoa powder’. They trade some arrows with him but eventually they end up stealing these as well. They obtain two of this strange powder but are unsure of what they have. ", "6. Residential area- mostly tree with houses built into the bark itself or suspended from branches, or even within the tree (there will be one house with an old female elf who talks about the one human that used to live here, he was a kind man, but society warped him) sir styx raids a house with a family in it, takes their porridge and eats it in front of them, dad screams that medicine was in there, melodrama ensues, regurgitate back into his mouth ", "7.

The Sacred Grove- where the druids are (did not visit)", "~~~", "Meeting with the Ancient One, Doran, and the Circle", "-Three elves dressed in naturalistic attire, leaves, branches, you know the usual, approach you. They are obviously from the druid circle.", "-One of them is holding a wooden staff, which he plants firmly into the ground and says, “Bickman and the Boys, you are wanted for an audience with the Ancient One and the Circle.” ", "“Before we proceed, we do ask however that you hand over all your weapons. You will not be needing them and they will be returned to you afterwards.” ", "-They eventually all agree but the elf that tries to lift Sir Styx’s sword from his back is unable to do so, the blade clearly unable to wielded by normal mortals. ", "“Thank you for your… cooperation. Please, follow us to the World Tree. Aside from the Ancient One, someone important also requested to meet you, he arrived earlier today.”", "-You make your way deeper into the city centre onto a boat. In the middle of the lake is where the tallest tree stands, the Banksia World Tree. The area around here is pristine and well kept, and it seems that most of the elves stay clear of this sacred site, save for the group of druids standing outside the hollowed out entrance. ", "-They step aside and allow you in. Inside as you look up at the roof there is a massive chandelier dangling in the centre of this room, with fireflies buzzing around in the hundreds of light bulbs that comprise it. The air here has a pleasant aroma of lavender and jasmine, which is soon ruined by Sir Styx’s dirty ass. Platforms made from the bark of the tree itself form a staircase that spirals around and around to the very top, but to where you can’t see as the roof blocks your vision. ", "-Tyrande says to Tim, “Your wolf form might be easier here, they say there around 3000 steps upwards.”", "-Grundle comes back with hookshot ", "-You follow Tyrande up, as well as the three druids who are escorting up these stairs. Every single step of this staircase is perfectly identical and for some reason you do not seem to tire, it’s like the tree itself is breathing life into you. Grundle taps Sir Styx on the shoulder and asks you whether he can help Thorin up the stairs instead, since he is the strongest physically in the party. ", "-You finally reach the top of these stairs. You’re in what looks like a throne room, a long flowing red carpet that starts from the top of the stairs all the way to an intricate, throne of vines and branches interwoven by magic. There is currently no one sitting on atop it. To your left hand side, as you all assemble, you see Arthalas and Dom wearing ceremonial robes instead of their hunter attire. He gives you a swift nod and resumes to standing upright, he has a very serious face on and is betraying no signs of emotion. To your right is Malfurion who is still wearing a scornful face, he is backed up by about seven of the druids from the circle. Tyrande and the three druids accompanying you take their leave and go towards their respective groups. ", "-Lux whispers in Tim’s ear. ", "“You know, we might be the only humans here in who knows how many years. Makes you feel a bit… special.” ", "-In the blackness from behind the throne you can make out three figures approaching you. The elves do not budge an inch but instead, bow. Arthalas opens one eye and looks at you all from the corner of his eye, expecting you to do the same. The party does not bow.", "-When they emerge into the light you now see these three figures. There is a young child, she looks like an elf yet she has very distinct features and her eyes betray her age. The air around her almost feels mystical, wizened, aged. She is helped onto the throne by a beautiful female elf, dressed in a translucent silk dress that hugs her body and caresses her curves. The last of the three, you recognise.", "-It’s Doran. ", "“Haha, yes, long time no see.” You must have a lot of questions. I’ll try my best to answer. But for now, I believe the Ancient One is who you were wanting to meet to begin with.”", "-Ancient One speaks but party can’t hear her, it’s almost as if she’s just emanating magic. Instead, another young elf translates her words to the party:", ">have seen the party in a vision but asks them about their true purpose here", ">explain about the origins of the world (the progenitor race, the fact that the gods do not exist, Auron is the last dragon meant to save everyone, gods are dying, they have little time left, and the ancient one herself is dying)", "-She is a noble eladrin, sometimes simply called eladrin, a powerful being infused with the power of the feywild. She is one of the progenitor races and of comparative strength to demon princes. She is the progenitor race for the elves. The only other progenitors she is aware of is Lucifer (for the abyssal beings) and Guts (for the greenskin races) but she hasn’t heard from Guts for a long time. ", "She reveals two massive bomb shells: the gods are not real and are just a construct, which doesn’t seem to phase Sir Styx but actually fucks everyone else up. The gods are real in the sense that they have the most power in the celestial plane but that they were not the creators of the worlds, that instead there was a creator race that created the gods and the first beings on all the worlds, like sewing seeds. The second bomb shell was that this wasn’t the first time that the party met with the Ancient One. This was the third time. She has reset the world every time when Lucifer destroyed every other plane and Thera was the last bastion. But for some reason, this third cycle, Lucifer has gotten into Thera straight after destroying Earth- why??? What’s caused this change?", "-According to the ancient one, the reason Lucifer even does what he does is because when Doran discovered that the gods didn’t exist and that they were just created by the unknown creator race, he lost all his will to do his duty as the guardian of the overworld. Out of anger and frustration of the prophecy written by the creators and not knowing what his true purpose is anymore he destroys everything out of spite. (Is this the full story though, it seems like it’s not complete, is this really the reason he has become the destroyer?) ", ">party is also dying so the ancient one gives them some of her own lifeforce, this causes the druids to freak out and be hella pissed (Doran interjects saying that the Ancient One has been feeling more ill as of late, almost sporadically, probably the stress of all the events unfolding)", ">Feud between the druids and the elves about whether they should help or not", ">why should we help them, they killed the last Listener (the elven queen)", ">the trouble with Grelivia ", "-Doran explains that he has been alive for a long time", ">known as Merlin, Nicholas Flamel, John Dee, Jesus, the Plane Strider", ">gives them updates on the goblin city etc, and on the war, and on the meetings etc", ">says that truthfully, this isn’t the first time that demon invasion has happened, this is the third time (earth was the second), they are mass extinction effects", ">all the weaponry used by the heroes of the ages were finally stored here in this plane of Thera as Celestial arms", ">there is one in the temple of the city by the lake, said to be a sword set in stone inside but no outsiders are granted entry unless they are recognised by the elves as ", "“qual’voran”, worthy (the ancient one agrees)", "-More arguing between them all about what they should do. Although the ancient one is the one keeping this place alive, she confers the judgement to the druids so they say that the elves will not truly follow until the party proves that they are worthy. How will they prove that they are worthy? Does the party have any suggestions?", "-Arthalas suggests they hunt down the Dirlagraun, druid makes it harder by saying the feral ones are still a threat, and grelivia still rampant. Deal with these two tasks and you will be worthy", ">druids still angry because now the barrier will be weakened, all life is being maintained by the Ancient One here.

He also reveals that Merihim, the prince of plagues, has been summoned just a day ago and his sickness has already spread amongst the villages of North Australis. However, since the ritual was also not completely successful, probably due to the previous attempt being foiled by Bickman and the Boys back in West Australis, only his physical form was summoned into this plane.

Styx responds with hitting Yarrick in the face with the stick and telling him to call him ‘warlord.’", "-Yarrick comes back with many welts and bruises from getting striked all the time. As the party get into their bedrolls and tries to sleep, Yarrick is bristling with excitement and continues talking to them. He talks about how the negotiations with the dwarves (and West Australis, Namati and Warband forces) went poorly, so only a small detachment of 200 dwarves were sent from Urulu). Also the talk of a princess returning to the city and that everyone was eager for the landsmeet", "-Yarrick talks for hours and hours until it is midnight. He shows no signs of stopping.

Merihim, the prince of plagues, one of the dark apostles of Lucifer… was near.", "Splitting from the main group, Bickman and the Boys decided to investigate the outlying villages in North Australis while the rest of the company headed straight towards the capital. In the first village, Kulimtun, they came across several dead villagers and some cultists who had deserted their post. Additionally, they met a Halfling named Yarrick Danton.

She felt a chilling, bony finger brush along the side of her face that burnt her so intensely that she felt it in her core. She lashed out with her hands, fighting this gripping presence which refused to let go. As if in response, the hand vanished and a swirling fog began to surround her. It felt her out as it permeated her senses, a haze of velvery black coalescing before her and then subsequently dissipating. This rhythmic cycle was accompanied by an eerily soothing voice which tickled her eardrums.", "“Saroza…” ", "Saroza did not respond but continued to struggle against this presence physically.

There are thickets of sterile and useless wood to their left, leaves a bruised brown colour, the cobblestone path they are walking on has dead weeds growing between the cracks.", "-The party is concerned when they witness Auron trying to breathe life back into the plants and fauna along the way but to no effect. This plague seems to be a more advanced case than the one they had previously encountered.", "-Seeing all of the bleak scenery, Yarrick Danton tries to cheer up the party with some small talk. He asks Saroza about her parents, considering how rare a union between a human and orc is. He asks her whether she knows her parents but Saroza is not in the mood to answer such questions and answers absent-mindedly, letting the halfling believes what he wants to believe", "-He also asks Tim about his foot and how he came to lose it. Tim, almost jokingly, states that portals are a fickle thing and not to be taken lightly. Yarrick agrees that portals are usually frowned upon by the Templarus order for their unpredictability. He then makes a little joke about Tim’s condition, saying that Tim ought to write a footnote for their holy texts. Although this does elicit a chuckle from Tim, he cautions the young halfling that such jokes usually lead to death in these troubling times. There is good news to all this however, Yarrick reveals that he knows a certain Master Panvon , a Halfling artificer (and coincidentally, his uncle) who can help to fix Tim’s foot. The halfling squire says that the procedure would require a very rare ingredient known as Green Hag blood, which Tim happily notes that they already have procured. ", "-Yarrick is about to approach Dig but is taken aback by the dragonborn’s otherworldly appearance and instead clambers back to Styx. He asks Styx about the scar that runs on the left side of his face. Styx actually has forgotten about this particular wound, having acquired so many throughout all his battles as a true barbarian. With some reminders from the party, he recounts how he faced Beezelbub in a brutal battle and suffered a gash from his spectral greataxe. ", "-Yarrick then asks Styx about why they have a tiger (Auron) and why his behaviour is so strange. Dig gets triggered upon this observation, accusing Yarrick of being an idiot and not even knowing what a real tiger looked like anyway. Yarrick retorted by saying that tigers don’t usually try to wave their front paws about as if they are trying to fly. There is a bit of suspicion here on the side of Yarrick but with a ominous glare from the dragonborn sorcerer, this is quickly dispelled.", "-Lastly, the party also find a little bit about the Templarus order and Yarrick. He came from nothing, parents were drunks who sold him into slavery but he was picked up by the Grand master of the Templarus. Then trained to be a squire for Sir Luther Lightbringer, but he was killed in the recent expedition. ", "~~~", "Meharn", "It wasn’t too much longer until they reached their destination; it was still early morning and at last they neared a village that Yarrick confirmed to be Meharn. There were no heavy fortifications here or fancy towering structures, only small simple huts and a few vegetable gardens dotting the landscape ahead. They could make out what looked likea circle of racks possibly ten metres in length deeper inside the village. Yarrick suggested that they were probably used for tanning and hanging animal carcasses, as was to be expected for a hunting village such as Meharn. From their current distance, approximately 600 metres, they could not discern any more detail of the village itself. The party knew what had to be done. To the left of them, Yarrick Danton gulped audibly as his knuckles tightened around the shaft of his pike. He looked up at each of Bickman and the Boys, and let out a sigh before saying, “Um… shall we?”", "-It is eerily quiet, not an animal or human in sight, only tracks. The party overhear two cultists on the other side of a village hut, engaged in a conversation about a green stone. Before any more information can be garnered, Styx decides to leap from the shadows and cut down the two cultists. He makes quick work of them.", "-They then witness a turning ceremony where a cult fanatic has slime poured onto him and then is possessed by a demon soul and turned into a chaos knight while screaming about devotion and whatnot:", "“Today we as followers of the Dark Apostle Sloth, the Prince of Plagues, give ourselves fully to his great unclean self and purge ourselves of all doubt. Believers, look unto me as I take my first steps into the paradise known as the abyss!”", "Then his form was replaced by an unholy presence in demonic garb. Its only words now in a guttural infernal tongue, “Xe wyrjy zmy erulty ao ediqfyw. Gdarh za zmy fltdyil aly.” ", "-Party dispatch all the cultists and even the chaos knight but find that the creature upon death then formed a small portal in which another lesser demon appeared. To their surprise, they find a small, frightened imp. Both Styx and Saroza attempt to grapple the creature but fail miserably as the small creature darts left and right, dashing through the village. It attempts to conceal itself with an invisibility spell but Dig wants none of that. He waves the Eye of Melora and the illusory magic is dispelled at an instant. Dig then summons a hand from the earth which grabs the Imp, holding him place while the party interrogate him.", "-The imp drives a hard bargain and doesn’t give much information at all, saying that all is futile and that the only purpose was to serve Lucifer. The party laughs at this contradictory philosophy of the imp; that he would both practice nihilism as well as have religious fervor. The party tries to interrogate the imp for more information regarding the plague in North Australis but to no avail. Although the imp tries to sweeten the deal several times the party decide they have had enough with his pathetic demon and ask Yarrick to execute the creature. Yarrick hesitates mid swing and Dig decides to finish the job by crushing the life out of the Imp with his earthen fist and ramming it under the ground surface. ", "-They look around the village a bit more for any survivors and Saroza does notice a hand underneath some rubble in one of the nearby houses. Styx sees this too and helps Saroza to pull the arm out. They succeed, but succeed too much and feel the arm make a ‘pop’ sound as they pull a body from underneath the rubble. There is an old man here and it is obvious from just looking at him that he will be a dead man soon. They learn from this dying man that a demon (they gather that it’s Merihim) was carrying a green stone which killed the other villagers before they were taken away. He revealed that they were heading towards Witchfield but were not sure for what purpose. Tim used his magic to ease the pain of this man before he passed into the void. ", "-Satisfied the party decide to travel towards Witchfield... but not before dumping the body of the man into a well. This does not end well as all of a sudden they hear a low groan escape from the 100ft deep well. The man had turned into a zombie. It was then that the party realised that Merihim was causing another zombie outbreak but this time it was going to be worse. The party encourage Yarrick to kill the zombie and he does so with a guiding bolt spell, a searing bolt of light energy that kills the zombie instantly as it pierces its brain. This act of magical power surprises the party momentarily but they soon recall that Yarrick is a squire in training to a paladin order. Tim tells the party that they need to remove the body from the water inside the well, lest it continue to poison the water source. He conjures a magical light inside the well to see if there are any more bodies in the well and to their relief, only the body of the recently deceased dead/undead was present.", "-Styx comes up with a brilliant idea. He has Saroza tie some rope around his waist while he ropes down the well to grab the corpse and then pulled up by Saroza. Saroza does not possess the strength to hold up the heavy weight goblin and finds herself falling into the well with the rope attached to her. Now both the half-orc and goblin are flailing around in the water of the 100ft well. They try to clamber up (while holding the corpse) by having their backs to the sides of the well walls and supporting each other’s weights. Their shimmying does no good however as Saroza falls only after climbing 10ft. To the shock of everyone involved, Styx actually manages to get to about 20ft up before succumbing to the power of gravity. Tim shouts out to the two in the well that he could help to levitate them up if they could get 40ft up (since his range was limited for this particular spell). Seeing no other alternative, Styx put both the corpse and Saroza onto his shoulder before trying a desperate hookshot upwards. He just manages to succeed as the hookshot propels them upwards, Tim does not hesitate and lifts them out of the well and onto land. ", "-They decide to burn the body of the zombie after making sure from Barnabus that it will be safe. Barnabus also makes a mention that the reason why they are not suffering from the effects of the plague is because they have the soul of the Ancient One within them, probably making them immune to the effects", "-The party depart for Witchfield...", "~~~", "Witchfield (afternoon)", "They travelled along the Cronana Freeway for about two hours. Yarrick explained that usually the surrounding greenery was teaming with bountiful wildlife but it is was if everything had gone quiet- died. The wind around the party began to howl as the light gale from earlier morphed into something sinister. Auron was ending closer to the party as if even he felt a strangeness in the air. It should only have been late in the afternoon but already, dark clouds began to gather overheard, carving the path ahead of Bickman and the Boys in a forlorn shadow. Truly, it was like the land itself wass aware of the trials and tribulations that they were heading towards. ", "Eventually, the village of Witchfield began to appear in their view. The first thing they noticed was the screeching calls of vultures and other scavenger birds circling the village overhead, their black wings flapping about in the auburn sky. Several agricultural fields that even at this time seemed quite vibrant and healthy filled their vision. There were voluminous, green fields for a few cattle, wheat fields, vegetable farms, and fruit farms that stretched on for as long as their eyes could see. They were walking amidst a garden of life and this especially stirred Saroza’s heart. Contrasting from the luscious fields of emerald and gold, lifeless and gray brick buildings signifying the human settlements populated the remainder of the large expanse. Additionally, a hastily constructed wooden palisade walls was present, circling the entire village in a 11ft barrier. ", "The party found themselves at the entrance of Witchfield and weregreeted by a lone guard. Behind him they could hear cries and screams from villagers, as well as a chorus of swearing and curses. ", "The guard eyed the party up and down. He was very confused at seeing the bulky goblin and the equally short Halfling bounding along beside him. Then he stared at the tiger before becoming transfixed onto the dragonborn. When he finally spoke, he addressed the only human in the group, Tim. ", "“Be you a travelling circus? State the purpose of your visit.” ", "-The guard, who they find out is named Rylo Ken, does little to show his distrust in nonhumans. He is punched three times by Saroza and has his jawbone rearranged as he continues to slander the nonhumans in the group. It turns out that he is the last soldier sent in by the King of North Australis and that, as the party gathered, they were facing an undead crisis. Witchfield had just suffered an attack the previous night by zombies that seemed to come from the surrounding villages and begged for the party’s help. The party follow Rylo to the village centre when they come upon a dispute between the Quinton the village chief and Horst the blacksmith. ", "-A dispute between Quinton (Village chief) and Horst (blacksmith) about the sick villagers, they are basically corpses at this point with the faintest signs of life. Quinton claims that the villagers are now dangerous and likely to turn into zombies and threaten the living but Horst says that to kill them now would essentially be murder and he wouldn’t stand for it. This argument continues until the party come along. The party agrees to help Witchfield with defending them against another zombie attack for the night and Quinton defers the judgement of the sick to them. Although Horst appeals to the humanity of the situation, Tim says that it would be too dangerous to keep the sick alive and that sometimes, there was a fate worse than death. Still unconvinced, the party decide to leave the diplomacy to Yarrick in order to bolster his confidence. Yarrick stammers and stutters throughout his sentences but does hammer the point home to Horst that there were some things worse than death. Horst reluctantly accepts and says that he wished to be the one to slit the throats of the sick and burn them. It should be noted at this point that the party forget to ask the villagers about the daughter of a dead hunter they found a couple days prior. They were supposed to return a necklace to a girl in the village of Witchfield.", "-Party helps the village to prepare for the attack.", "~~~", "Preparation for the incoming horde at Witchfield (afternoon)", "-Tim talks to Quinton, the mayor, on what sort of defences they could prepare before the night comes.

At this altar Sir Styx finds a part of the berserker set (greaves) and receives a vision of a greenskin being in a tundra of white. After this they go to investigate a ruined church upon a hill to the east of the village, they find nothing of interest there.", "-Party sends out scouts to alert them early of where the horde will come from", "-Dig sets up an earthen fist in the south gate.

Undoubtedly, this causes some stir in the village as the bodies of their loved ones are burnt but it is a necessary deed to ensure the survival of the living.

There are around fifty of them.", "-They set up as follows: Dig and Auron to the south wall, Saroza upon a hill outside the west wall of the village, Tim situated near the mayor’s house to the north west, Styx to the north wall, Yarrick Danton and Rylo Ken to the east wall. With each of them they have about 60 peasants to command.", "~~~", "The horde advances on Witchfield (night)", "-They see the horde early and set up their positions to brace against the gates.

Something must be controlling them.", "-The battle went as follows:", "Saroza spots horde to the west but is unable to get many clear shots on them as they advance towards the west gate and pound on it with all their might. She descends the hill swiftly as she can and gets into a small gap that the builders built earlier in the west wall. She makes careful attempts to not step into the line of oil running near the west wall.", "Tim sees a horde advancing into the massive garden of the mayor’s house and without hesitation, sends out a firebolt to ignite the oil. The light show is glorious as hundreds of bodies are burnt and incinerated on the spot. The fire goes all the way from the garden all the way to the horde on the west gate near Saroza. However, both groups still continue to advance despite suffering moderate losses. Eventually, the horde at the west gate bust through, but Saroza is ready and waiting with her peasant force.", "The horde at the north gate have smashed through the gate somewhat, there are holes in the gate which Styx and his peasant army use to stab the zombies through. However, this doesn’t do much as they must also brace against the gate. Eventually, despite all their efforts the horde at the north finally overwhelms them with sheer force and busts through into the village. ", "At the east gate, Yarrick, Rylo and the peasants brace against the horde.", "At the south gate, Dig and Auron do the same.", "To the party’s horror, every peasant that fell to the corpse mound was enveloped and assimilated into the mass.

From what you can see, she is a blue dragonborn, which you can tell from the sapphire scales which glint in the moonlight as she struts. She holds herself with a sense of pride and you realise that she is well respected, as each of the knights hold their spears to their sides and bow in deference as she walks past them. She is adorned with a regal red armour, there are dangerous looking spikes on the underside of her gauntlets and greaves, with strange spiral symbols made of gold which seem to wrap around the entire plate mail body.

Bickman and the Boys stood together on the main deck (between the forecastle and the quarterdeck) of the glorious Dragonfly, feeling their bonesrattle from the chilling northern wind which first whipped the sails of the Dragonfly before lashing at its crew. Dig would often regale the Boys withtales of dragonborn being able to retain pockets of heat in their scales but - as Styx eloquently pointed out- this was ‘fucking bullshit’ because all of the draconian knights around them were noticeably shuddering even through their red plate armour.

It reminded the Boys of the Namati desert and their adventures in those perilous sands. Already, it felt like aeons ago since they had defeated Beezelbub and overthrew the demon and his clutches on the Warband.

He had not intended to go on such a wild adventure or expected to be in the company of such a diverse bunch of Boys, even if some of them were always in the thick of trouble. ", "Dig was occupied with the architecture and design of the Dragonfly as it had been so long since he had seen the marvels of his people, having been exiled from the fatherland for some time now.

The goblin was already tired of the entire spectacle. Flying ships, wyverns, dragonborn, what was so special about it? He’d seen more spectacular things in Goblin City and he hadn’t even been there before! Instead he found himself passing the time by chasing Yarrick across the upper works with his boar blade, insisting that this would improve the halfling’s fighting ability. It didn’t really, especially due to the fact that Yarrick was in his nightgown and clearly not rested enough after his close brush with death a few hours prior. ", "Even as they stood around a makeshift fireplace, trying to warm their bones by its faint embers, they could feel the dissent among the Europan fleet. It was becoming increasingly clear to Bickman and the Boys that there was growing tension and distrust between them and the draconian knights. Maybe some of it could have been attributed to fear of their power. It wasn’t an everyday occurrence to see a group of four adventurers essentially man-handle a demon lord, the Prince of Plagues himself. What’s more, they were in the company of a golden dragon, a creature which had not been sighted in Thera for centuries, perhaps millenia.None of the draconian knights openly displayed their wariness of course, out of respect. However, none dared to venture too close to the group either, always keeping a wide berth as they circumvented the Boys.

It was definitely worth it. He saved his malady. ", "As Toothless departed them, Tim spoke up.

Reflexively, the Admiral swung around to swipe at Styx but the goblin ducked underneath the blow (not that he had to duck much with his stature) and it drew blood from Dig’s right forearm.

The party greeted Big Brother with lazy waves of their hands and they continued towards the wyvern pens located near the quarter deck.", "Bickman and the Boys could smell the wyvern pens before they could even see them, the thick, pungent, odour of wyvern waste was wafting towards their vicinity. All but Saroza and the Admiral were threatened with the risk of expelling their food from the previous day. Inside the wyvern pens, aside from the numerous draconic creatures nesting within their titanium cages, sat a draconian knight who was busy shining what appeared to be a saddle. It was unusually shaped, arched in the centre at a rather obtuse angle, possibly to compensate for the curvature in the wyverns’ spines as they took flight. ", "“Beastmaster.” Taliyah bowed her head in acknowledgement.", "The beastmaster shuffled quickly, dropping the saddle from being caught unawares, and bowed his head lower than Taylah’s.

Hand it over to the beastmaster.”", "“As if,” Styx sniggered.", "“You refuse? Even after your pitiful showing against the demon lord?”", "The warlord muttered something in response but it was too quiet even to be noticed by the Admiral’s keen ears. ", "“Whatever.” He handed the blade over to the beastmaster, who struggled with the massive blade once Styx had let go of his grip on its worn handle. ", "“What is this thing made of?” The beastmaster’s face the very picture of incredulity. ", "He slowly hoisted it up to a workbench where a pot of some colourless liquid was kept. With nimble fingers and experienced motions, the beastmaster applied this oil onto the blade, while the party watched it drool over the silvered metal like sweet honey. After he finished, he stopped to admire his handiwork for a few moments before dragging the blade back to the impatient goblin.", "“Give it a go,” pushed Taliyah.", "Styx was not the least impressed. Surely this wyvern oil would do as much good as the ‘silver’ they had coated their weapons in, which was no good at all. It was only as Styx swung his boar blade in a spiral arc towards Saroza’s head, missing by mere inches, that he realised the potency of the wyvern oil treatment. ", "Styx mustered all his eloquence. ", "“What the fuck?” ", "Saroza stepped forward, unsheathing her bladed longbow and katanas. She crossed her arms with her gaze fixed on the beastmaster. The beastmaster didn’t need much more of a cue so he retrieved the weapons from the ranger and followed the same methodical treatment of wyvern oil. The bow’s strings were reattached and coated in this oil, working wonders just like that seen in the goblin’s greatsword. But when the oil made contact with Yamato, the weapon gifted to Saroza by Musashi back in the city of Napaj, the oil itself seemed to fizzle out into nothingness. The oil evaporated as it kissed the katana’s edge, the blade’s unquenchable thirst draining the oil of all its strength. ", "“Damn,” Saroza sighed as she retrieved her weapons. ", "~~~", "The manticore cannon was the next marvel witnessed by the Boys. The Admiral took special pride mentioning the scores of deadly foes that the imperial superweapon had vanquished, citing how little effort it took and the unbridled havoc that it could wrought with a single shot.

", "“Not in the ssslightest. The Imperial Engineers in Draconis designed this cannon so that it would be cost-effective as well as powerful.” ", "“How does it fire exactly?” Tim repeated.", "“Magic...” ", "Smartass, Dig snorted.", "“Magic,” she continued, “channeled from the ranks of spellcasters in the fleet. They take turns so as to now allow themselves to be completely drained of all magical power. The more energy channeled into the weapon, the bigger the effect. As in, you point at the enemy and they will cease to exist,” she declared proudly. ", "“Right.” Tim decided to push further. ", "“How many of your soldiers are magically proficient?”", "“All of them, naturally. Unlike your backwater country, if you excuse me sssaying this, our troops are handpicked from the finest of dragonborn stock. They possess the highest calibre of skill in both the physical and the arcane. You will find no weak draconian knights within my fleet.”", "Saroza wasn’t the patriotic sort but she refused to stand idle as her friends were insulted. ", "“Yes, they were so incredible that the majority of your knights perished under your command when you faced the Leviathan.” ", "Tim decided to push the attack. ", "“Do you not realise that if this weapon was to fall into the wrong hands, there would be no hope for us? This manticore cannon of yours must be protected at all cost. How can you be sure that you can even control such a force to begin with?”", "“Enough!” Taliyah snapped. The party could hear a faint growl from the other side of the upper works which sounded like a warning from Toothless. ", "“I will not sssuffer insults from guests upon my ship. If you doubt my ability to lead or the ssstrength of Europa, then feel free to leave on your own accord. I will not ssstand by and be verbally lambasted!” ", "The wizard was certain that he could levitate or even transform into a falcon if he wished, leaving the ship would not be an issue. However, losing an ally in the draconian fleet, even as diminished as they were, would be a heavy blow to the resistance forces. What’s more, the manticore cannon may not have been enough to solely take down the demon lord Leviathan, but no other weapon existed in all of Thera with as much power. Europan machines were objectively superior to anything in Australis- not even the dwarves of Urulu with their incredible artisan skills could hope to best the Dragonfly. ", "“I apologise if we offended you.” Tim bowed respectfully. ", "“Truly. We have all had a long day and are weary from our travels. I am sure that your men are also feeling the same.”", "“Not an excuse for rudenesss,” Taliyah said.", "“But it is an excuse to head to the bar,” Dig interrupted. ", "“Show us the control room, let us grab the owl and Auron from your room and then let us drink, be merry and forget this nonsense.” ", "Styx bellowed, “Fuck yeah, mate!” He slapped Yarrick on his behind, eliciting a startled cry from the halfling squire.", "~~~", "The control room was best described as outlandish from the perspective of the Boys. Tim felt especially disdainful to the myriad of machinery and technology being used. The wizard didn’t want to admit it but he felt that magic was superior to metal in every way, airships be damned. The rest of the party however, stood in awe as Taliyah ran them through the different nuances of controlling the Dragonfly.", "It was when they entered the Admiral’s quarters that they gained further insight into her character. The room was practical, sporting no furniture except for a chair positioned in front of a window that saw the entire bow of the ship and a rug next to a fireplace in the middle of the room. Taliyah herself was as practical and as plain. Not to say she was unremarkable of course, but she certainly wore her emotions on her sleeve. ", "Owl Gore, in one swift motion, perched itself on Saroza’s shoulder, greedily eyeing the rotting rat carcasses that the ranger was pulling from her pockets. Before it could enjoy its little snack, a certain goblin barbarian crossed the distance between them with great strides and with an almighty leap, snatched the dangling rats and stuffed them into his own face. He was promptly attacked by Owl Gore, who pecked at the goblin’s balding head incessantly. ", "Auron trotted up towards Bickman and the Boys, growling in delight at being reunited. Tim and Dig were relieved to see that the young golden dragon, who was now large enough to be considered a wyrmling, was safe and sound. ", "“I’m curiousss,” Taliyah commented as she closed the door, “how much do you know about dragon physiology?”", "Dig shrugged while massaging a tiny area behind Auron’s neck. The dragon shrilled in response. ", "“Not much. We haven’t exactly met many dragon experts during our travels.”", "“Well, I myself have happened to ssstumble upon some texts about such matters. Incredibly rare as I’m sure you all are aware. It turnsss out that dragons usually reach full physical maturity within four months. How long have you been travelling with your Auron?”", "Tim thought to himself. ", "“I believe it must be nearing six months now...”", "“Nonsense,” Dig said. ", "“It’s been two months at most.”", "Tim smirked. ", "“You’re right, I was mistaken. Time flies when you’re with this lot.” He pointed towards Styx, who was now chasing Yarrick around with a stick while continuing to be pursued by Owl Gore around the fireplace. The trio darted around the cabin while Tim shook his head in embarrassment. ", "“He has definitely grown in all the time we’ve been together.” Dig watched as Auron approached Toothless, the sorcerer being ready to intervene should the wyvern try anything daring against the young golden dragon. Instead, he was astounded to see the royal wyvern bowing its head down in deference to Auron. He was glad. ", "Tim strode over to Auron and placed a hand firmly on the dragon’s snout. He immediately felt a surge of energy, of raw magical power and an overwhelming sense of divinity. It was like a warm, radiating wave of goodness, simply pure goodness. ", "“Auron has grown in both size and power,” he noted with an air of pride akin to that of a proud parent watching their toddler walk for the first time. ", "In the background, Yarrick Danton raced out of the cabin sporting a magical garment weaved by Tim’s illusory magic. Styx insisted that the halfling be dressed in his plate mail as he should always be vigilant and prepared. Yarrick sprinted out of the room, already out of breath. Unfortunately, the halfling’s decency would not stay preserved, his attire being dispelled involuntarily by Dig’s Eye of Melora.", "~~~", "3. The Bar", "Taliyah initially opposed the idea of venturing into the barracks-turned-bar on the second floor of the Dragonfly. It didn’t take much convincing on behalf of the Boys to change her mind, it was fairly obvious that she herself was thirsting for some strong liquor. ", "“I don’t blame her you know?” Saroza said. ", "“After what we’ve seen, we really do need a drink.”", "“Just like the Witchfielders that are here. Look.” Tim pointed to a group of villagers from Witchfield who were commiserating over the dead and the lost. ", "“Sad times, indeed.”", "Styx pushed past his companions as he made a running start to the counter. ", "“Fuck being sad! I’m gonna get smashed and dance with the ladies!” ", "Dig started to follow the goblin. ", "“There aren’t many ladies, present company exempted, but the little shit is right. Let’s go wind down.”", "It didn’t take long for the action to start.", "Three draconian knights were sat directly at the counter, downing what looked like mugs of vodka. Apparently the drink was real big in Europa and most of the citizens refused to drink much else, especially the ever barbaric mead, or god forbid, ale.", "“Well, well, well,” the largest of the three draconian knights stepped forward to stand toe-to-toe with Styx (figuratively, since the goblin barely reached up to his knee), “what do we have here?”", "The barbarian raised an eyebrow at the troublemaker. ", "“What the fuck do you want, mate?”", "“Nothing in particular. It’s just that I’m not sure you want to get a drink?”", "The rest of the party had now arrived at the scene and were seeing the spectacle unfold before them. Tim and Dig could already feel that the situation was going to spiral out of control but decided it futile to resist the flow of chaos about to ensue here.", "“I will ask again,” Styx brought himself as high up as he could, perched on the balls of his feet as he glared at the dragonborn, “what the fuck do you want?”", "“Are you daft? Get the fu-”", "WHAM!", "The largest of the knights dropped instantly, taken down by a savage right hook. The barbarian was in a fit of rage now and the knight’s companions were shocked into attention. Before the one to the left could react, Saroza stepped in and choke slammed him into the ground beside his fallen companion. She finished the job with a flurry of bows and was about to deliver a brutal kick into his crotch until Taliyah came storming down the stairways.", "“What isss the meaning of this?” The Admiral’s blue scales were tinged in red now.", "“He started it!” Styx exclaimed.", "“I beg your pardon, goblin? Are you sssuggesting that my men assaulted guests under my watch? I would seriously reassesss your accusations, Styx.”", "“No, he shouldn’t.” Tim stepped forward to intervene. ", "“I know you might find it hard to believe, Admiral, but your men were the ones who were starting to cause trouble. My companions simply ended the minor threat before it became a major one.”", "“You knocked out two of my knightsss.”", "“Judging from the praise you showered upon them, I didn’t think that were possible, dear Admiral.”", "“You... enough of this. You three, get out of here before I lose my patience. You are hereby banned from entering the bar and instead will endure fifty lashesss. Daily.”", "It took a while for the offending knights to leave because Saroza knocked out the other with another punch. Beating people felt nice, like therapy, she decided. Taliyah didn’t notice or pretended to not notice the angry stares from the three draconian knights as they spit on the floor beside her and exited the room. ", "Her attention turned back to the party. ", "“No more trouble pleassse. I’m quite done with drama and politics for the time being. I’m going to... I’m going to get a drink.” She did as she said she would. ", "Bickman and the Boys followed suit, first joining in the Witchfielders’ mourning for the dead, before livening up the entire place and dancing across tables, singing loudly and obnoxiously and drinking much more liquor than their body could handle. Tim found quiet comfort as he retreated behind the bar and shared a few bottles of Europan whisky with the draconian chef. The dragonborn was surprisingly tolerant of foreigners and was very pleasant company but try as he might, Tim would not be able to recall the chef’s name until their next encounter. Dig, Styx and Saroza led the revelry and danced the next few hours away, forgetting the threat of the demons, of dark apostles and demon lords. For now, all that mattered was having fun and being merry and although many things could be said about Bickman and the Boys, no one could say that they didn’t party the hardest in all of Thera. ", "~~~", "Tim started off towards his private quarters but was soon stopped at the door by an old draconian knight who clearly had too much to drink. His scales were blue just like the Taliyah dragonborn sorcerer’s except a more pale hue and his red armour was populated by various scratches and dents. Tim deduced that this knight was an experienced fighter or someone highly ranked within the draconian fleet.", "The draconian knight, with one hand holding a bottle of whisky, leaned in close to place his free hand on Tim’s shoulder. ", "“You’re with that whore aren’t ya?” A long gruesome scar that ran from his closed left eye all the way down to the middle of his chest was bared in front of the wizard’s face. ", "“What- what are you doing here, vagrant?”", "Tim attempted to yank the elderly dragonborn’s hand off his shoulder but found the grip to be firm. ", "“I am here with the Admiral if that’s what you are suggesting. My name is Tim, I take it you are someone of particular importance?”", "The dragonborn growled, “I don’t care who or what you are.” His breath reeked of strong liquor. ", "“What colour are my scales?”", "“A light shade of blue.”", "“Yes just like your friend, the Exile. He is making a mockery of our lightning ancestry.” He spat at the ground. ", "“For almost half of recorded history Europa and Australis have been inconflict. The barbarians of this country dared to strike back against their betters. They mimicked our governing system, our society and even our worship of dragons.” His eyes narrowed into slits. ", "“Then a dragon was finally found but it has allied itself with a lowly race of thieves.”", "“You are mistaken. The dragon chose us and that is that. Your Admiral has also approved of these actions so I would remind that you going against her orders is considered treason.”", "“Treason? Bah! That whore Taylah, damn her existence, is dishonouring our fallen and opposen the High King himself. She is a treasonous sviper, a harlot, a typical... woman. And what’s this?” She pointed at Saroza, who was dancing with the rest of the patrons while balancing mugs and plates on her body. ", "“A woman fighting! Are the Australis people so desperate as to have their own women fight for them?”", "Tim rolled his eyes. He didn’t want to listen to any more of this. With a click of his fingers he vanished into thin air, reappearing outside of the room and waiting for the old knight to walk away. The knight stumbled for a few moments, muttering to himself that he had just seen a ghost and eventually made his way up the stairs again while clutching his drink. Tim made his way back into the bar a few moments later and decided to pour himself another drink with the chef. The chef told him that the old knight’s name was Prag, that is, Vice Admiral Prag and that apparently, he was vehemently opposed to the decision of Taylah. The wizard’s intuition was that this would be a source of trouble in the future. He was quite right.", " ~~~", "Dig accompanied Taylah back to her cabin. He was inebriated at this point but still maintained his integrity and didn’t make any unwanted advances on the Admiral. She was stunning to be sure, strong and toned with a fierce yet not unattractive face. Dig considered himself quite the charmer too so he was certain that he himself wouldn’t need to make any moves because the lady would simply be unable to resist his appeal. ", "He was wrong, of course.", "The sorcerer sat on the rug with Auron nestled within his lap and he watched as Taylah carefully propped herself on the only seat in the room peering out the window. There was tiredness in her eyes, a weariness that Dig empathised with.", "“I will ssstop referring to you as Exile, I think,” she said out of the blue.", "“Oh.” The dragonborn was taken aback in surprise. ", "“I see.”", "“Dig, I want to talk to you about sssomething.”", "Here we go, Dig thought. ", "“Yeah Taliyah, I have always felt the same about y-”", "“The Kraken.”", "Fuck. ", "“Oh yes, the Kraken. What’s the Kraken?”", "A smile of sadness swept across her face. ", "“The Kraken is legend, or at least is sssupposed to be a legend that my people believed in. I don’t know which of these demon lord you claim it is, this creature you have dubbed the Leviathan, but I assure you that it is evil itssself. It is an ancient beast, we know this because there is no other creature in this land like it.", "“A ssswarm of twisting tentacles with venomous vipers lashing out from the tips of them, a multi-headed monstrosity. There must have been at least ssseven of them, all hellish, misshapen, crude formations of rotting flesh and fish scales. Dig... its body was covered in this chitin-like carapace, dried blood upon rotting flesh exposed in visible gapsss. It literally dripped death on those waters.” She grasped her forearm as if to steel herself from the memories. ", "“Guess how big it was Dig. How large this nightmare was.”", "“I have no idea. Maybe fifty metres?”", "“At least one hundred and fifty metresss. And that was just its torso and head. I don’t know whether you can comprehend this but half of the wyvern riders and all but this single ship were decimated in mere secondsss. The seas were calm and the ssskies clear in one moment and then the next moment we had descended into one of the nine realms of hell. Are you starting to get the picture?”", "“I’ve heard tales. So many tales now,” he continued to soothe Auron to sleep, “and they all are the same. This creature may be strong but you must trust in the Boys. We can defeat it.”", "“Trust? You ask me to have faith but I am a woman of facts and ssscience. Yet even I must resort to the gods’ favour.That being said, I get the feeling that the gods themselves do not listen, that they do not even exissst. If we can not trust in them who can we trust in?”", "“As I said,” Dig straightened himself up to bare his chest out, “you can trust in the Boys.”", "~~~", "4. The Summoning", "Aside from Dig, the rest of the Boys had passed out in the bar after copious amounts of drink and dance. But their rest would be short-lived, interrupted by a harsh screech which sounded like the grinding of gears combined with high pitched screams. It jolted the Boys up and immediately filled them with a weird sensation like something was gnawing at their joints and tendons, teasing their connective tissue. Saroza groaned as she struggled to her knees, feeling like she was tilting to one side. ", "Then the realisation struck.", "They were tilting to one side. The ship was imbalanced,shifting left and right under the pressure of its own weight. ", "What’s happening? She thought to herself. Styx and Tim were also starting to come to around her but she noticed that Yarrick was not getting up, showing no signs of awareness at all.", "All of a sudden, a frantic Barnabus broke free of its clasps and began yelling furiously at Tim, “Wake up, wake up, I sense it, I sense it, I sense… ABBADON!” ", "Tim’s daze disappeared as the words hit home. “It can’t be... where, Barnabus? Now.”", "“T-t-t-the bar!” Barnabus stammered. “Second floor! There, someone, summoning! Quickly!”", "Meanwhile, Dig had stirred from his rest inside Taylah’s cabin, as did Auron who was now alert and growling. Taylah raced to the upper deck to organise the men, she suspected the worst. Dig decided to join the rest of his companions in the bar, making sure to keep Auron safe by his side. ", "It didn’t take long for the sorcerer to reach the bar on the second deck. He burst through the door, using his shoulder as a battering ram and surveyed the room. Dig saw that his companions were now beginning to wake and saw that they had come to no harm, this gave him no shortage of relief but all around them... it was a bloodbath. Witchfielders and dragonborn alike were strewn across the floor like refuse, some still gasping for breath as their innards lay splayed out and others crawling towards the Boys. They were begging for help even as they continued bleeding out, unaware that half their torsos were missing. But the greatest shock to Dig was there were no monsters or demons. These injuries were carried out by a man. ", "For the first time, Styx betrayed a modicum of fear as he whispered, “Yarrick, is he-”", "“He’s fine,” Saroza said. ", "“Still breathing, barely.”", "Dig turned to the wizard as Auron paced around his feet. ", "“Tim, what is happening? I need a-”", "“Everyone!” Tim barked, “Upstairs! Now!”", "They were still somewhat groggy. Every now and then they had to stabilise themselves as the constant tipping and turning of the ship threatened to bowl them over at any instant. ", "CRACKLE!", "There was static in the air now as they ascended the stairway.Tim struggled viciously against the pain of his phantom limb and Styx even with his low centre of gravity was barely keeping on his feet. ", "Their hearts pounded so heavily that it threatened to collapse at any moment, suffocating from the pungent air, thick with dark, evil, abyssal magic. ", "Barnabus spluttered to Tim again, “There is a summoning, a summoning, a summoning, stop it before it’s too late!”", "“But alas,” the voice was melancholy,", "true sadness being echoed within each slowly enunciated syllable, as if this figure was savouring the taste of evil which permeated in the air, “it is already too late.”", "The party froze.", "Before them was the dark apostle known as Abbadon, Lucifer’s advisor and second-in-command to the dark lord. He floated in mid-air with his legs crossed as if in meditation, piercing yellow eyes which glowed like hot coals transfixed on the party as he sported a devilish grin. The demon’s flesh was contorted and he bore no hair, just a scalp that was excessively bloodied with bits missing out of it. Looking down, Saroza noticed a hole in place of where the demon’s heart should be, which was instead this black void which swallowed the light in its vicinity. The ranger felt drained of her conviction and her energy.", "But knelt down in front of Abbadon atop a summoning circle was the vice admiral, Prag, sweating but grinning ear to ear with a crazed look in his eyes. ", "There was no doubt. He had to have been the traitor. ", "“Yes, yes, finally I’m safe!” His eyes were manic, darting left and right as the party entered in sight.", "“Oh, hi there, boys, have you met my new friend, his name is Abby.”", "“As I promised, Vice Admiral, I will now make the pain go away.”", "The demon extended his arms outwards as if to hug the vice admiral and Prag responded by moving in closer accepting the invitation. Before they could form this twisted embrace, Tim shouted words of power while grasping the quarterstaff like an extension of his arms, aimed directly at the space between the two. A barrier of kinetic energy exploded into existence between the two, sending the vice admiral back a few steps. Saroza used the brief hesitation to drag the traitor back behind the rest of her companions.", "Tim concentrated on maintaining the barrier but to the advisor of Lucifer, the wall of force seemed more like a hindrance rather than an actual impeding force. With a long, hooked clawAbbadon tore the barrier like he was ripping through silk fabric and tossed aside the magic energy like used goods.", "“Another one of your fancy parlour tricks, wizard? Tut tut tut.” His index finger wagged from side to side. ", "“Abbadon...” Tim muttered through gritted teeth. ", "The dark apostle frowned and pointed a bony finger at the party. ", "“Oh if you only knew how much I would love to rip your souls out, how beautiful I could make your deaths.” He paused briefly. ", "“No... that’s cant be right. I already-” he sniffed the air through the two gaping holes where his nose should have been. ", "“No, you definitely were soulless when we last met I made extra sure of it. No, it couldn’t be...”he began to burst out into hysterical laughter, the sound of it was painful to hear, a sort of deep itch in the eardrum. ", "“I see. So the old coot has finally bit the bullet. And is that… BARNABUS!? NO, SURELY NOT!”", "Barnabus struggled with renewed vigour against the clasps of Tim’s belt. The wizard unfastened the straps holding Barnabus shut and allowed the celestial arm to say his peace. The arcane book spoke in an unknown language to the party but it sounded like a manner of abyssal tongue with noises and sounds that couldn’t be made by mortals. Tim felt a surge of energy as Barnabus sent out a hexing spell towards the demon. If there was any effect, it could not be seen or was not immediate, as Abbadon simply revealed a toothless snarl.", "“You have grown weak, Barnabus. Time amongst the mortals has dulled your senses.”", "For the first time, Barnabus was silent. Tim clasped the book shut, feeling a deep sense of dread slowly mounting within Barnabus and himself too. ", "Abbadon smirked. ", "“You have defeated the dark apostles of Sloth and Gluttony. So, I wonder, what do you think your chances are of defeating me? The dark apostle of Envy.”", "“The Boys will take you on any day, Abbadon,” Dig declared. The rest of the Boys took a step forward, including Auron. ", "“Let’s fuck him up!” Styx unsheathed his great boar blade and threatened with a reckless charge. To his left, Saroza was readying both her katanas.", "But Tim did not feel the same confidence. ", "“This is not the right time, guys. We are simply,” his eyes were cast downwards as he finished, “not strong enough at the moment.”", "The dark apostle laughed with grim satisfaction. ", "“Relax. I am unable to touch you. Do you not remember your little red haired angel, Cassiel? We had a pact, that I could never lay a hand on any of you as long as she lived.” The party felt small comfort in these words- at least she was still alive. ", "“She is a clever little vixen. For this whole time she has been chained in Hell, tortured, beaten, raped with no second for rest. Yet she has maintained her life force.” His eyes burned themselves into the minds of the Boys. ", "“But she is not who you remember her as, not even the most resilient of the gods could withstand this level of depravity. It’s only a matter of time before…”", "“Fuck you,” Styx said.", "“...regardless, it seems my work here is done. The vice admiral and I made a little pact, as is with your kind and ours. For exchange of peace of mind of which you deprived him of, he provided me with some information. Information, that is, of your whereabouts and of your plans. A landsmeet was it? In Windar? I like the way you think.”", "This time, Tim was the one to show some cheek. ", "“I don’t believe it.”", "“You better believe it, wizard. From now on we-”", "“I mean, you are supposed to be the adviser to Lucifer. You’re the supposed dark apostle of Envy and demon of who gives a crap but even then you were not able to sense entire armies and lands moving underneath your very nose!” Tim clenched his quarterstaff and challenged the demon lord. ", "“You know what, Abbadon? I’d say that maybe we can take you on!”", "“SILENCE!” Tim had succeeded in breaking Abbadon’s composure. ", "“You will all suffer merciless deaths, you will experience the most agonising, excruciating-”", "“Save the speech.” Dig folded his arms and took another step forward, staring the demon lord down. ", "“Heard it all before, from your other demon pals, that is, before we fucked them up.” The sorcerer nodded to the rest of the Boys. ", "“Ready?” ", "The demon scowled. ", "“Savour your seconds of satisfaction. You will see more of me yet. When a sacrifice, a real sacrifice has been made,” he gestured to the dozens of dead dragonborn and humans on the bar floor below, “then I will be able to walk freely upon this land of Thera. Then you will know the true power of a dark apostle. But for now, I leave you a small souvenir.” ", "“Take your souvenir and shove it up your ass,” Saroza snorted.", "The demon’s form shimmered in the light. His last words before he vanished were filled with a hint of excitement. ", "“I wish you a pleasant flight.”", "A scream sounded above deck louder than any fanfare. It was Taliyah’s. ", "Bickman and the Boys didn’t need another cue.", "~~~", "5. Battle in the Skies", "They raced out onto the upper works, dodging scurrying knights around the promenade deck along the way and flinching from the cannon fire already protesting around them. Saroza hoisted Prag over her shoulder and up the staircase, her leg muscles still not completely warm from her interrupted sleep. The skies were still dark, it must have been only a few hours since their drunken escapade. The air itself was incredibly stale and when they reached the upper deck they felt sudden lurches in their stomach, perhaps a mixture of fear and magical corruption. Dig ensured that Auron remained below the top deck. Even if he was a powerful dragon in his own right, they couldn’t risk his life in this battle. They needed to get to Windar and fast.", "Taylah Swiftwing stood beside the wyvern riders who were already mounted and listening to the Admiral barking orders. She hoisted her golden trident to the air and hopped onto the fierce Toothless. Her eyes were bloodshot, she didn’t get any rest it seemed, while surrounding her were draconian knights rushing tocannons to stopthem from falling over. The Dragonfly continued to sway perilously as she caught sight of the Boys. Looking up to the observatory tower above the main balloon, the party saw blood dripping from the post. Big Brother was dead. ", "“Men, I want order! I want results, no tarrying, I want more haste, not more speed!” Toothless roared defiantly at several black figures just appearing over the horizon. ", "“Boys, what is happening? The winds are calm yet the ship is being thrown about like a weightless ragdoll. Is this...” she shuddered at the thought, “a demonic attack?”", "The Boys nodded and Dig added, “One of the dark apostles named Abbadon sent a force of demons to our position thanks to this traitor.” He pointed an accusing finger at the vice admiral. ", "“This man.”", "“That is a serious accusation, Exi- Dig! Are you certain?”", "“There are demons on the way,” Tim interjected, “and you want to argue this right now? Get this man out of sight. We need to come up with a plan.”", "Taliyah commanded some knights to take the vice admiral away. Whatever harsh punishment she had in store for the traitor would have to wait because now the force was getting closer. They were monstrosities, comprised of flying creatures with weird, yet fascinating shapes. One of them looked like a reddish lizard with membranous wings and teeth in its beak. Saroza did not recognise the creature as a native of Australis as no flying beast in these lands had a wingspan of what looked like 100 feet across. On top of these creatures was a humanoid being which had the appearance of a rat mixed with a small man.", "“A pterosaur?” Saroza whispered to herself.", "“No, it can’t be...” Taylah gasped. ", "“A kongamato, or the ‘breaker of boats’. They are native creatures to Gymnasia and riding them are the ratfolk, another race of beast-kin that populate Gymnasia.”", "Saroza clenched her teeth. ", "“Could this mean that Gymnasia has aligned themselves with the enemy?”", "“I don’t care about those dinosaur looking bastards,” Styx groaned. ", "“What are those other things in the air? What is that blue light that keeps flaring from behind them?”", "Barnabus was the one to respond, breaking free from his restraints once more. ", "“Lunar devils, lunar devils!”", "Tim placed a reassuring hand on the book’s cover, allowing a flow of warm energy from himself to the celestial arm. ", "“Barnabus, calm down, what are we looking at here?” ", "“Lunar devils are harsh creatures, powered by the strength of the moonlight. But this must have been an attack out of haste for the moon is not out. This is good, very good indeed. Their magical powers will be all but non-existent. We may stand a chance! But they are still physically powerful, still a threat, still a danger. We must-” Tim closed the book and nodded to the Boys.", "Dig spoke, “What are you orders, Admiral?”", "“The situation is grim. Gymnasia may have allied themselves against Thera herself, truly troubling. But for now, you must all listen.” Taliyah cleared her throat and bellowed to the wyvern riders, the party and the crew of draconian knights manning the guns on ship. ", "“We face once more an army of demons and their ilk, outnumbered and outflanked with no sure signs of victory!” Her eyes scanned the crowd of red plated knights and their reptilian mounts. ", "“But we are the shield of the Europan people! We are blessed by the High King Char-Chill himself and no enemy, be it a demon or foreign army, can hope to match the might of the Draconian Fleet! To me, brothers and sisters, to me! Fly! Fly and conquer the skies, children!” Then once more, in draconic, “Alis propriis volat!”", "The air buzzed with warcries and chants of prayer, the flapping of wyvern wings and the banging of steel against shields as the entire cohort of wyvern riders rode out to meet the assailants under the cover of the early morn. Taylah was the last to depart, watching her riders take flight in all their glory as the ship continued to battle against the battering winds. ", "The Admiral gave one last look to the Boys and gave her last order. ", "“Get the ship to Windar in one piece. The gods watch over you.”", "“And you,” Dig bowed. ", "Toothless quadriceps bulged as it took long bounding leaps off the deck to the skies, roaring alongside Taylah as they too joined the rest of the wyvern riders in what seemed to the Boys as a suicidal pact.", "Then just like that, the Boys were left alone with the rest of the draconic crew, awaiting what was to come. ", "~~~", "Styx’s instincts told him that the eerie blue glow in the distance wasn’t friendly. He was extremely pissed off because his squire, Yarrick Danton, was already unconscious in the bar and all attempts at waking him up had failed. The demons were going to pay dearly. Besides, he felt like swinging his sword arm a few times.", "The wyvern riders were not faring well. They were holding the line, sure, but it was evident that it was a losing battle. Already, some lunar demons and kongamata who separated from the main force were about to assault the Dragonfly from all sides. The crew were dispirited because they were all aware that this predicament was brought about by one of their own, they had brought this on themselves.", "Styx gripped one of the knights by the neck of his plate mail and dangled him over the port side of the ship. ", "“Look at this, dragonborn! Stand and fight or I will personally drop you all off the ship and then you won’t have to worry about the demons!”", "Dig stepped in to intervene before matters descended into madness. He warmed the men with tales of their valour, promised them that they would see the sunrise and that before long, they would finish this campaign and go back home to see their loved ones. A necessarily lie which the rest of the Boys were aware of. Likely, most would never see the light of day again, especially against this foe.", "The first of the kongamata smashed the hull of the ship, sending it tilting even more violently than it was already was. Dig and Tim continued shooting spells at the assailants alongside cannon fire from the three decks of guns on the Dragonfly. But it was no use, there were too many of them and they were too nimble, dodging and skirting away from the gunfire like they were mere hindrances. Saroza shot true, felling down dozens with her pinpoint accuracy. Her arms strained with the massive amount of effort required to use her bladed longbow at such long distances. ", "Styx had another idea.", "The barbarian steadied himself, lowering his centre of gravity and began laughing crazily to himself. ", "He aimed his wrist at a nearby kongamata approaching from the left side. ", "Dig saw too late. ", "“Styx! What the fuck are you-”", "The goblin soared through the air like a majestic albatross, piercing several clouds with his massive frame, before colliding headfirst into a ratkin who was saddled on the flying beast. Before the rider could even utter a single word of surprise, Styx backhanded him with a punishing slap and sent him falling down into the depths below. Next, he channeled all of his primal fury and knowledge to control the kongamata. At first, the creature resisted, bucking left and right and almost smashing into the balloon of the Dragonfly but with a solid elbow onto its forehead, the dazed creature started flying the opposite direction. Towards the blue light that Styx was still seeing ahead of him. ", "His instincts proved right. For ahead of him, was a creature that the Boys did not think could exist in Thera. Its body was aged, partially decomposed and resembling more a corpse than the living. Soaring through the sky, it blotted out the sun with its streamline black body, making nary a sound but a high pitched screech which temporarily disabled the crew on the ship. Then, skeletalised wings with membranous wings outstretched and a long tail which lashed violently in the skies. Jet blue flame erupted from its jaws with such force that it shattered several guns on the second deck and punched a great hole into the Dragonfly’s forecastle.", "“Shit!” Tim held onto the railing to avoid falling over from the impact. ", "“It’s a dracolich!”", "An undead dragon. Powerful. Evil. ", "There wasn’t any time for awe. Something had to be done. ", "Styx piloted the kongamata through the air, hurling themselves higher and higher until they were well above the dracolich, no ounce of fear in the barbarian’s being. He leapt, unsheathing his greatsword at the same time, and plummeted downwards at terminal velocity towards the dracolich’s exposed neck. ", "His landing was stopped by the blade of another. As his feet made contact with the solid surface of the undead dragon’s neck, he peered up to see that there was someone riding the creature or rather, something. This being had an overwhelming presence, a peak physique and eyes that seemed to stare directly into Styx’s soul. It left no room for doubt that he was a contending with a Death Knight, fallen paladins who resonated with evil strongly. The goblin recognised this death knight. After all, how could he not? He had spent so many hours interrogating Yarrick and asking him about the Templarus Order that he knew exactly who this man was, who this man used to be.", "“Luther Lightbringer,” Styx cursed.", "The death knight’s blue eyes glinted briefly as if remembering something, then resumed to piercingly glare at the goblin barbarian. Then there were no more words to exchange as the two swordsmen swung at each other atop the flying dracolich.", "Meanwhile, some kongamata had been set alight and then rammed into the side of the Dragonfly. She was taking a beating, so much so that Tim was starting to think of escape plans in the back of his mind. Some of the rat folk had dismounted their kongamata in time and were now circling the crew with small daggers in hand. ", "“A trifling matter.” Tim raised his quarterstaff high in the air, drawing in heat from his surroundings. ", "“Farewell.” A huge globule of fire soaked through all of the rat folk, killing them on the spot, while others rolled around in hopelessness as the flames bit through their flesh and bones. ", "Dig unleashed his lightning breath, much to the excitement of the crew beside him, also scorching rat folk that had landed behind them on the quarterdeck. ", "“Saroza, do you need some help there?”", "Saroza had been caught off guard as the rat folk surrounded her while she was shooting at the flying monsters. Though she parried her three attackers with relative ease, she was in no position to return a counter, instead being on the backfoot as the ratfolk threatened to throw her overboard. It was at this moment that Dig’s lightning breath penetrated the three of them such that all that remained of them was their sizzled skeletons bleaching on the deck. Saroza gave a weak salute to Dig, glad for the assistance, but a bit ashamed that she had nearly been bested. ", "Now, lunar demons were tearing away at the wooden hull of the ship from the rear. They landed, shredding draconian knights into two, even through their thick metal plate. Saroza raced forward to intercept them as Dig and Tim made their way to the bow of the ship. ", "Another stream of blue fire from the dracolich smashed the side of the ship. ", "“Gah!” Dig cursed as he tripped over the corpse of an enemy. ", "“We need to stop that thing! The manticore cannon, Tim! Get there now!”", "Tim nodded as he hobbled towards the superweapon. ", "“What of you, my friend?”", "“Look there, where the dracolich is still hovering and readying for its next attack. On top of its neck is Styx battling what looks like some undead knight of sorts. I’m going to see what I can do.”", "“Best of luck, Bickman.”", "He snorted. ", "“Who needs luck?”", " ~~~", "Sparks danced vivaciously as the swords of the death knight and the barbarian clashed. The two were caught in a dance of death, Styx continuing to hammer each blow with brutal force. The first swing of the barbarian caught the death knight clean on his chest plate and managed to penetrate the thick armour, drawing thick black blood. ", "Styx roared in laughter as he took the chance to leap forward and deliver a helm crushing blow with his boar blade but this confidence caused him to overextend his footing, instead having to use all of his upper body to stopfrom falling off the dracolich’s back. In mere seconds the evil paladin slashed downwards and carved his blade downwards at Styx’s shoulder.", "The goblin used his uncanny reflexes to dodge a mortal strike but a wound now opened on his forearm, blood dripping from a deep gash made by the sharp steel. Cursing, he dropped his boar blade and forced his two burly arms around his opponent, drawing him close and yelling into his deathly visage. The death knight’s face was contorted with confusion as the goblin hoisted his frame as if weighed no more than a feather. He resisted, scratching Styx’s in several places as the three foot goblin held the death knight by the throat now, leaning over the edge of the dracolich.", "And Styx dropped him. ", "With a smug look on his face, Styx bent down to retrieve his boar blade then looked high up into the sky and chanted his name to he heavens. ", "“Witness the might of-”", "A piercing beam shredded the right wing of the dracolich and unbalanced the creature. No amount of acrobatics could avoid Styxfrom falling over to his doom. ", " ~~~", "The manticore cannon had struck the dracolich twice at this point but they were glancing shots and failed to bring the undead beast down. Tim of Felbourne desperately needed this next shot to hit or it would spell the end, a certain untimely end. He channeled his magical energies into the conduit for the manticore cannon, feeling vast reserves of energy being siphoned from his being. The aiming reticle for the cannon was deceptively small and even adjusting the sights was a laborious and time consuming task. Another blast from the dracolich shook the ship once more. ", "This was it.", "Tim closed his eyes and pressed the two triggers used to fire the manticore cannon. ", "“W-w-wait!” Barnabus stuttered.", "If Barnabus was more observant, he would have told Tim that Styx was still on the dracolich and that he had actually succeeded in taking down the death knight. He would have alerted Tim to delay the shot by a few seconds so that Styx could safely disembark from the creature. But alas, time was not on the side of the heroes and Styx hurtled over the edge as the manticore cannon shredded through the dracolich’s membranous wing. ", "~~~", "Saroza had her back to the walls, facing against a trio of lunar demons snapping at her neck and torso. One of the lunar demons succeeded in lightly wounding the ranger on her left thigh but she managed to parry a lethal blow with her katana. Using the same momentum from her parry she swiped with her Yamato blade and beheaded the demon where it stood. The other two lunar demons continued to close in.", "It was then that Tim appeared from his misty step, standing at the forecastle and shouting magical incantations. Before the ranger’s eyes, arcane tentacles bristling with celestial power imprisoned the demons and held the entire unit of lunar demons, not just the two beside Saroza, at bay. Saroza, with the assistance of a couple of the crew, made quick work of the imprisoned lunar demons. ", "Dig and Tim were more concerned with the goblin barbarian that was still in freefall.", "“Why isn’t he using his grappling hook?” Dig yelled over the tumultuous noise of battle.", "“The impact of the manticore cannon must have shaken him,” Tim said. ", "“I’ve messaged some of the wyvern riders to return already. They should be able to intercept him.”", "“I’ve got a better idea.” Dig’s arms circled in the air as his eyes flared an emerald green. In his mind, he pictured the concept of flight and used this to shape Styx’s corporeal form. ", "The barbarian, now in the form of a raven, glided effortlessly in the air and glided beside the assisting wyvern riders who had come under the beckon of Tim. ", "Tim’s robes rustled as he stepped towards the dragonborn sorcerer. ", "“Dig...”", "“Don’t interrupt please, I’m casting a concentration-”", "“The dracolich!”", "Dig’s eyes widened as the wounded undead dragon appeared in full sight. Although it was heavily injured, it was still keeping in the air and was jerking its head back with a deathly roar. ", "“Styx!” Dig pointed frantically at the wyvern riders beside the polymorphed goblin. He didn’t check to see whether Styx understood or not. Instead, he focused all of his efforts onto the dracolich. He chanted the words of polymorph again, this time with increased speed and increased exertion of his magical reserves. ", "“You genius son of a bitch!” Tim laughed as the dracolich was now in the form of a small sparrow. ", "There was a chorus of amusement and amazement from the crew aboard the Dragonfly. One of the mightiest foes they had ever encountered was turned into a mere triviality by Dig Bickman. This would not be a feat that would go forgotten, that is, if they survived this ordeal at all.", "“Now,” Dig commanded, “get to the manticore cannon firing conduit Tim. Use your messaging spell to tell Styx to get the dracolich in place. A direct shot. Do you understand?”", "Tim nodded in affirmation and misty stepped back into firing position. Styx likewise received his orders and barked at his wyvern rider rescuers to situate themselves before the cannon.", "The stage was now set. Dig channeled a portion of his energy into Tim who directed the flow of magic into the energy tank of the manticore cannon. The sparrow-turned-dracolich was now directly in front of the cannon, it was impossible to miss. ", "Tim grinned. ", "“Go to hell.”", "The ship itself rocked from the recoil of the colossal manticore cannon. The entire front vicinity of the cannon was obliterated in an instant. ", "Unfortunately, Tim realised too late what he had done. ", "The wyvern riders escorting Styx and the goblin himself, were holding the sparrow in place and did not move in time before the wizard decided to fire.", "~~~", "*Guys I’m really sorry but I’ve been writing this for a week and I’m deathly tired.Need to stop spending time on the recap and start writing the next session in a few days RIP.

He is most likely going to die", "-No more time to think because the wyvern riders are still getting destroyed by the demons and Windar is now in sight but the ship is crashing down hard, the balloon getting destroyed has caused the ship’s stability to get absolutely destroyed. The only thing keeping them relatively afloat are the various mechanisms within the engine room on the lower deck (party never explored this room, plus I forgot to mention it to them lel)", "-Tim and Dig both race to the control room and Dig tries to work the controls by remembering brief instances of training back in his time in Draconis. Unfortunately, he fucks up and half the guns on the left side of the ship get ejected LOOOOL. ", "-Next, Dig uses his perception to find a manual which is also written in draconic. But before he uses it, Tim rushes in with Barnabus. Barnabus before anyone says a word jumps out of his holster and devours the book, literally.", "-Dig is like WTF LOL and Tim’s like Barnabus are you fucking kidding me? And Barnabus says that that is how he digests information, literally haha fuck DM you are so funny, and so then he explains to them the right way to ease the descent.

Where am I? Why can I not feel anything.", "Darkness enveloped them once more.", "You jolt back awake, trying to blink away the pain that is now creeping up your spine, what is it? A tingle? It feels more like something is eating away at your body, starting from the tips of your toes and working its way up your spinal column to the back of your tender neck. Your ears start to ring and you fear it might be an attack of some sort but then you realise it’s your ears adjusting to sound. There are some people talking. ", "“We’re losing them. They’ve lost too much blood.

They’re bleeding out. Their hopes of survival are slim at best! Now go! Post-haste!”You can hear footsteps thundering past you, each impact against the tiles causing your head to ring.

It’s night, in fact, everything around you is shrouded in complete blackness except for the light from the campfire that you’re sitting in front of. The rest of your companions are situated around this single campfire, all of them. You see even Robin, Lux, Hugh, Thorin, Grundle, Dumbo, Auron, Owl Gore, Binker Tell. You sit in silence. It’s so peaceful, so calm. ", "-Dig hangs out with Hugh Myrin, talking about the old times. It seems that the dragonborn even in this state, misses his old companion", "-The rest of the party continue to relax but Tim notices something isn’t right. He manages to break out of this dream-like trance using his magical mind and assists Dig in doing the same", "In the distance, an orb of white light seems to blend in to existence. Slowly but surely it begins to melt away the darkness and replace it with its warmth. It is a calming presence, you’re not sure what it is, but just being close to this white light seems like the right thing to do. The more it inches towards you, the more you feel at peace with yourself, your troubles, every trouble that you’ve ever experienced even the ones you have forgotten in the deep recesses of your mind, they slip away before it. The white light shapes itself into the form of an arm, it is as delicate as a woman’s, slender, and gentle, like a mother’s, it reaches out to yours… if you touch it, you could forget about everything, forever…", "-Saroza and Styx are also tempted by this white light. They see themselves split into two halves. This triggers Saroza who, with extreme concentration, determines that everything happening is fake. Styx continues to stroll towards the white light and his impending doom but Saroza leaps onto Styx and begs him to snap out of it. Styx finally snaps out of it.", "You are conscious again.

Cover them up and take them to the morgue.”", "“Wait!” A female voice stops everyone in their tracks.

You’re in a white room on a bed, the rest of your companions next to you in a line. There are a few vials on the ground, empty but with traces of some purple liquid inside. You are now all up again still feeling fatigued and weak, but finally conscious and fully in control of your own body.", "-Saroza tries to pick up one of the vials but drops it due to her lack of strength. The rest of the party wake up and realise that they are in a hospital. Tim finds it miraculous that they even survived at all.", "That’s when you see who your saviour is.", "It’s a woman. Long flowing white hair almost like it was bleached white, slender frame, fair skinned, average height. She doesn’t look that remarkable, pretty, not beautiful, but pretty. It’s just another human. Except… she can’t be. Her eyes are piercingly blue, they have this almost distant look, like she’s not actually looking at you but rather through you. When you pay closer attention you can even make out some faint lines on her face and neck, as if her flesh was pieced together like a jigsaw. She wears a black maid uniform with white lace and long thigh high boots. She isn’t human, but she isn’t completely machine either. Strange. When she notices you all staring at her, she begins to speak once more. ", "“Question: How does Bickman and the Boys feel at the present moment?”", "-Dig and Saroza are happy to be alive. Styx is impetuous and wants to go explore the city (he assumes that he is in Windar) and Tim wants some answers. ", "-Dig asks the stranger who she is? ", "“Acknowledged. This is Unit A.B.”", "-Party surmise that she is a robot/android/cyborg of some sort. Saroza tests this out by picking up one of the glass vials and throwing it at her but accidentally misses and hits Styx in the face. This ends up increasing his vitality.", "-The party notice that they are only wearing hospital gowns and they are not happy with this. They ask Unit A.B. to get them a change of clothes.", "She ducks out of the room for a quick instant and returns with a whole line of clothing on her arms, looking like a clothes line. ", "“You are currently in hospital gowns. Your usual attire and all your gear is being washed at Master Panvon’s house so you must choose between these outfits for the time being.”These clothes seem to have been provided from Master Panvon because all Unit A.B. has are two nice looking doublets and two dresses. ", "-In a comical fashion, Styx decides to take the dress but rips off the upper half so only his privates are being covered by the torn dress. Tim and Saroza both take the doublet. Dig decides that he does not need to wear anything and prefers to remain bare and in the flesh. He requests a hood but Unit A.B. says that she does not have one. She ends up incinerating the remaining dress with a flamethrower built into her hand.

My nephew, or is it grandson I can’t right remember, uhhh Yarrick Danton, he told me everything! Unfortunately he had to return to duties with the Templarus folk but he asked me to help you all. After all, it’s been two days and none of you moved a muscle! HA! Anyhow, unit A.B. knows absolutely everything, well, at least, everything that I know! Actually that pretty much means everything. She knows the city layout, gossip, history, and can even protect you should the need arise so feel free to ask her on what you missed. Oh and one more thing before I go, the king requested your presence when you awoke. If you want to see me you will find me in the copper quarter, the big workshop near the slums. Alright, too-do-loo!’ END TRANSMISSION.” ", "-Tim, Saroza and Styx do attempt to ask a few questions.

", "-Unit A.B. says that she cannot allow them to exit the hospital. Saroza and Styx try to reason with her. Styx attempts to intimidate the cyborg/robot/android (let’s call her a warforged starting from this point forward) but realises that she is immune.", "-Tim decides to outwit the warforged by giving her a statement to process: ", "“This statement is false.” Unit A.B. tries to process it but ends up shutting down due to a system error. Very clever, wizard. ", "-Styx jumps out of bed first and rushes out the front doors, inadvertently knocking over the team of doctors and nurses that had been operating on them prior. Tim and Saroza follow closely behind. ", "-Dig decides that he wishes to know more from Unit A.B. about their predicament and after waiting for the warforged to reboot.

What’s been happening?", "“A flying airship was seen plummeting from the skies in the early hours of the morning two days prior. Three species of flying creatures identified to be of demonic, draconic and bestial nature were spotted directly behind the ship engaged in battle. Two species of flying creatures were destroyed by artillery on city walls. Inhabitants of the city were shocked and fear was rampant in the city. Public populace now stabilised. Council of Regents and King under extreme stress.” ", "5. Were there any other survivors?", "“Dragonborn identified on the ship. Number of survivors, estimated at seven hundred. They are currently all in chains, awaiting a decision from the King.”", "6. What happened to Taylah?", "“Target unknown. No information present on database.”", "7. What is the fate of the ship?", "“The flying ship sighted two days prior crash landed near the east wall of the city. No casualties were reported on the ground.

The King’s summons…", "“The king has informed Master Panvon that he desires to meet with Bickman and the Boys. No further details have been given.”", "9. Tell me more about the city…", "“Windar is the capital city of North Australis, formerly known as the Kingdom of Allesia. Windar was once home to the elves before they departed to their new capital in the Kingdom of Attadale.

The city is best known as a port city, big on trade and tourism.” ", "“Windar is divided into four quarters, each depicting a species of dragon native to Australis. The copper quarter, the bronze quarter, the silver quarter, and the gold quarter. The copper quarter is where the majority of the populace reside, the bronze quarter is where most entertainment complexes exist, silver is where trade exists, and gold quarter where the nobles and the ivory keep reside.”", "“Windar is protected by the Templarus Order and the Academy. The Templarus Order ensure that the law is upheld, they are particularly in charge of crimes such as theft, murder, and so forth. The Academy police the use of magic within the city as well as crimes of a magical nature. As such, Unit A.B. wishes to warn Bickman and the Boys of using magic without a magical license issued by the Archmage.”", "10. Where is Auron and Owl Gore?", "“Yarrick managed to sneak the dragon and the owl into Master Panvon’s house before they could be seen.”", "-Actually in truth, no one asked to know more about the city - question 9- but I still included it because it’s important information (The DM wishes that his players would ASK MORE QUESTIONS AND INTERACT WITH THE WORLD MORE HINT HINT COUGH COUGH)", "-Dig vows to set the dragonborn free after realising that every single dragonborn in the city was imprisoned. He tries to polymorph himself but can’t. This is where Unit A.B. reminds him that he is unable to cast magic without a magical license. He isn’t happy with this but walks out naked anyway.", "-With no more questions, Dig asks to be reunited with the rest of the Boys. Unit A.B. complies and instructs Dig to take her hand.

", "The Courtyard", "Taking your first steps out into the fresh air, you feel like a newborn baby exiting its mother’s womb for the very first time. It is morning, sun is out shining and it is neither too hot nor cold. All things considered a good day. You step outside to the sounds of chatter and the distant dins of daily life. Outside the hospital doors you find yourselves in a courtyard. It is a spacious area filled with benches, ornate walls with overhangs adorned with dragon heads and rows and rows of flora. The garden’s floral arrangements are similar to that in Napaj. The flowers are varied and beautiful, every colour of the rainbow is represented here and it feels like you’ve stepped onto a cloud.

They’ve even got a larger female goblin?”One of the nobles seems to be intoxicated, incredibly intoxicated, because you find him stumbling past a small fern tree and falling in front of you. He picks himself up. ", "“Are you *hiccup* the Boys?”", "-The party is not liking where this is going. They admit to the heinous crime of being the Boys and the drunken lout accuses them of being ones with the demons, working with the Europans and Gymnasians.", "His hands reach incredibly close to Saroza and he begins to stare at her cleavage as he fumbles his next words.

", "“By Moradin…” ", "She is dressed differently, in a silk dress that reaches all the way to her feet, she is wearing a corset underneath or must be, because her waist is incredibly tight. Her face also seems to have been touched up because she is positively beautiful. She stands there, eyes agape for a couple of seconds before she throws her arms around each of you, telling you how much she’s missed you and stuttering about random trivialities. Then she gets to Tim. She steps closer, forgetting herself for a moment and is about to embrace you but slowly lowers her arms… ", "-Everyone but Tim gets a super warm embrace by the beautiful, ever so beautiful, Luxanna Dawnchaser.

To start off with, Tim is already playing cautiously with the priestess that usually fawns over him. Instead of returning her embrace he simply pats her on the head like the heartless bastard that he is, and tells her that it’s good to see her. (Wizard-zoned). ", "Also, Tim tries to message the rest of the party but realises he can’t use magic (he remembers that there is a forcefield of some sort around Windar that prevents the uses of magic unless sanctioned by the Academy). But he is super pissed about this because he insists that he payed all of his school fees IN ADVANCE and he payed the union too. What a fucking outrage.", "The wizard sighs.

I thought that when the ship crashed and you were spotted on it, I… thought the worst. Anyway, this is not the time or place, we can speak later. Where are you headed for the time being?”Tim responds, “Off to the Academy.” ", "“I see. And after?”", "“The King I suppose.”", "“I have a meeting with the king too but it seems that I will be after you. Do you have any clue as to why I have been summoned, did you receive any message perhaps?”", "“I did not.” ", "“Hmm… strange. In any case, behave yourselves.” She looks concerned because she was particularly worried for Styx. ", "“This isn’t a commoner or any other noble, this is the King of the North. He holds power that perhaps even rivals the Dragon Emperor. The king, that is,my father, is a stubborn man. You might not necessarily agree with this methods or viewpoints but you must respect them. I would be most devastated if I was to see you hanging by the gallows. Tim shrugs. ", "“What is new? Tougher men have wanted us dead and yet here we stand.”", "“That’s the problem with you Boys. I've only seen you for a second and already half of you are off again on your next adventure. Always the same thing. Do you ever spare a thought for the rest of us who care about you?”Tim averted his gaze, shifting his feet uncomfortably.", "“Apart from that, you are in good hands. I met your friend Yarrick by the way, a couple of days ago when I saw Master Panvon.”", "“Well that’s good news. How is he?”", "“He is doing well. He was awfully concerned for you all. It was Yarrick that convinced Master Panvon to send Unit A.B. here and treat you.” ", "“Great.”Lux, sensing the indifference of the wizard, had had enough. ", "“Why do you treat me like this Tim? Am I some major inconvenience to you?”Tim had to pause for a moment. ", "“No... maybe just a minor one.”", "“...”", "-Lux takes her leave. She is supposed to meet with the king after the Boys but ends up going first. She says she will explain to the king that they were delayed. Funnily, Tim had forgotten that Lux was actually the daughter of the king, even though he had learnt otherwise several times. It may have been due to the fact that he didn’t want much to do with Lux anymore, she was too persistent, too eager to get with Tim. I do feel sorry for her, after all the reasons that she is so interested to Tim include but are not limited to: (1) Tim was a major proponent of her successful rescue from the Warband camp, (2) Tim was quite a handsome looking wizard and (3) Lux and Tim in the previous two cycles had been living together happily as a married couple and she remembered a lot of those past lives whereas for some reason or another, Tim does not. ", "Mechanicus Adeptus (Copper Quarter)", "-They step foot into the Copper Quarter and it is pretty much the exact opposite of the splendors in the golden quarter. There is a lot of poverty here, not surprising because the slums where the halflings stay live there. The party recognises the segregation between peoples. The streets are gray, the clouds seem to block the sun here and the people’s faces are lifeless. There are a few stalls here and there but for the whole, it’s just a whole lot of cobblestone and stony faces.", "-The party continue forward but begin to get heckled and approached by several of the city folk. Some as usual are accusing them of being the enemy and bringing demons to their doors while others praise them as heroes. It seems that the people’s opinions of Bickman and the Boys vary differently. Actually, a little boy runs up to Dig Bickman and is genuinely curious about the dragonborn but Saroza ends up throwing the kid into an alleyway where the rest of his friends chase after to check he is still breathing. This doesn’t help with the Boy’s public standing.", "-Unit A.B. is still escorting them at this point and not providing much conversation. The sight of her still sort of unnerves the party who aren’t too trustful of the warforged. She seems alright but she is playing at being human which is ‘weirding’ them out", "-They get glimpses of a group of halflings acting strangely, scratching their skin wildly and speaking in weird languages. Dig investigates but finds that apart from the wounds the halflings were inflicting on themselves, they seemed normal. There was no sign of any magic or drug use either so Dig is at a total loss as to what could be the cause of this strange behaviour. When he grabs one of the halflings, a middle aged man, he asks him what the problem is. All of the strange individuals start blabbering on about their nightmares. Dig is extremely confused. Styx and Saroza have also gone into the alleyway now but seeing the scene before them they wish not to get involved. Dig decides to take the halfling to the Mechanicus Adeptus where this so called Master Panvon may be able to assist.", "-They finally reach the front door of the workshop, of Master Panvon’s house essentially; The Mechanicus Adeptus. Unit A.B. is about to knock on the door but she invites the party to do so instead because apparently she has been banned by the master. The party refuse and so Unit A.B. knocks on the door. But she does so with inhuman strength and it knocks the door clean off its hinges, smashing into the back of the room. ", "-Cue the sound of pots and pans banging over as the party hear someone curse loudly inside the room. It is a dark room so they can barely make out anything. Realising that no one is coming to the front, the party decide to step inside.-", "-Inside the workshop are rows of benches with different apparatus, liquids, boiling potions, steam, kettles, pans and pots all over the place, utter chaos. No room to move. ", "-There they see Master Panvon. He has a long flowing beard and several layers of glasses, mechanically whizzing in clockwise rotations, large bulging googly eyeballs are visible through the glasses as he inches closer. Wears a metal pot on top of his head, and has several exoskeleton arms moving behind him. The party are about to engage in dialogue but they are hushed quiet by the halfling man who claims that the government are trying to listen to his thoughts (pointing to the pot on his head as he says so). Styx asks for a metal pot to wear too and after much searching Master Panvon also gives him one.", "-Is completely unaware of who they are until Unit A.B. explains to him that they are Bickman and the Boys. He greets them eccentrically, the party aren’t quite sure what to make of the halfling inventor. He asks them how they are and then resumes his work. He utters to himself that the new generation are all so rude, not even offering him thanks for the treatment he prescribed to them in the hospital of Windar.", "-He asks the party why they are still there, what they want. The party request for their belongings as well as Owl Gore and Auron. They retrieve all of their belongings from a chest and Dig begins to play with Auron again. It seems that apparently Yarrick hid Auron here when he recovered from the crashed ship and prevented anyone from seeing the golden dragon.", "-Master Panvon suddenly remembers that he was supposed to operate on one of them; a surgery of some sort. Unfortunately Tim is not with them so he is unable to speak for himself. Styx and Saroza take the opportunity to apply for some surgery of their own. Styx wishes for an exoskeleton like the halfling’s whereas Saroza (hopefully in jest) asks for a third arm. Styx is outright refused and this causes the barbarian to actively cause trouble. The goblin threatens Master Panvon to which Unit A.B. must restrain the goblin (and by restrain she literally kicks his ass and tosses him out the front of the workshop).", "-Saroza changes her mind and requests a scope for her bow similar to the goggles worn by Master Panvon. He thinks for a moment and brings out a sack of gold containing 1000 gold pieces as thanks for saving Yarrick. He says that instead of rewarding them as requested by his nephew, he would take the gold and craft her the scope instead. Saroza is pissed off and hates the deal and tries to negotiate. Master Panvon requests Yamato, the hobgoblin katana given to her by Musashi back in Napaj, but she outright refuses this of course. The second deal is more intriguing: bringing a special artefact from the Springs of Allesia; he calls it the Philosopher’s Stone but apparently it has many names. Saroza agrees, hoping that the party will have time amongst all other things, such as that of the DEMON INVASION LOL", "-The party leave the workshop. Dig decides to leave Auron with Master Panvon, hoping that the halfling will take care of him. There was no way that they could bring Auron in the open, especially because Dig couldn’t use his magic to polymorph the dragon. As they leave, Dig sees one bench that is absolutely clean unlike all the others. The only thing on top of the bench is a framed picture of a woman with white hair, fair blue eyes and porcelain skin. Saroza knocks it over on purpose (out of spite because the halfling made it hard).", "-This triggers the halfling to leap across all the benches and knock the dragonborn over. The halfling begins beating down on the dragonborn mercilessly. Dig was caught unawares but is finally able to push Master Panvon off and throw him back to the other end of the room. Master Panvon is frantic, begging Dig to put the picture back. Dig does so and steps out of the room, wondering why the halfling had become so crazed. The last thing the party hear as Master Panvon begins fitting the door back to the hinges is, “Abby...” ", "-Saroza is the first to make the connection. Unit A.B... could she be Abby, a mechanical substitute for a dead wife? Or was Unit A.B. actually the wife? She is unsure but decides not to press any further as the party decide to make their way back to the golden quarter for an audience with the king.", "The Academy Tower (Silver Quarter)", "-Tim finds his way to the silver quarter of the city, making his way to the Academy Tower. It is a spiraling tower with magical energies sparkling like electricity around conduits placed in precise locations of power. As such, the tower is always surrounded by an eerie blue glow, something that startles the nearby nobles constantly and a constant reminder of the presence of the unknown", "-On the way to the tower he is reunited with an old classmate, named Samon. Samon insists on getting drinks with Tim and desperately begging for his companionship. Tim manages to slip from his grasp and confronts two guards standing in the front of the tower", "-He argues with the guards for ages, claiming that he had paid off all of his fees and demanding to see the Archmage. The guards do not believe Tim and laugh in his face. It turned out that the license was not a physical one but instead a sort of enchantment that the Archmage made upon magical practitioners in the Vault of Souls located in the tower. ", "-Samon offers to help Tim to get a license but Tim decides to take his losses and leave to reunite with the rest of the party", "Audience with the King ", "-The party reunite with each other back in the Golden quarter, finally ready to have an audience with King Mikel-Gunner Dawnchaser ", "Unit A.B. leads you down a pathway that’s been set in with quartzite stone between the long dense grasses. She leads you eventually into a corridor. To your left and right are statues of dragons, each majestic. The ones at the start are extremely large, in fact they span for at least fifteen metres. But the further down you walk through this hallway the dragons shrink until the ones at the end are no bigger than a common house cat. Unit A.B. comments, “Bickman and the Boys are now entering the throne room of the Ivory Keep. Recommendation: Refer to the King only as my Lord, or my King. Failure to do so may result in harsh consequences. Is this understood?”", "-Bickman and the Boys aren’t too concerned with this, especially Styx. They had already met with so many members of supposed royalty that they had began to become desensitized.", "The throne room is impressive. ", "Modest braziers surrounding each of the ten soapstone columns light up every part of the throne hall and coat everything in an orange glimmer. The illustration of battles on the domed ceiling dance in the flickering light while statuettes and statues look down upon the mosaic floor of this opulent hall. A violet rug runs from the throne down the center, where your party are currently standing, and loops back from both left and right while matching banners with adorned crowns cover parts of the walls. Between each banner stand several tapers of various sizes, a few of them have been lit and in turn illuminate the artistic portrayals of gods, goddesses and dragons below them. The broad, stained glass windows with symmetric designs are colored the same violet as the rugs and banners.", "But what catches your eye is the pompous throne of onyx in the shape of a dragon’s mouth which sits in front of a large window radiating light onto it. There are two adjoining seats, less ornate, to the left and right side of the seat. There is currently no one sitting on any of these seats.", "“It seems we are a little early.” A.B. remarks.", "“It would seem so,” Dig says.", "Before long, a bugle sounds and a procession of marching knights clad in full metal plate come in to view from a side room. Styx recognises them as Knights Templarus by the symbol in the middle of their chest plate: a dragon coiling around the sun.They enter while this ceremonious music plays in a double file. In between the two columns of knights are three individuals dressed differently to the metal plated warriors. Two of them are female. One of these women is dressed in golden plate mail with a coat of arms depicting a dragon. She has short blonde hair and wears a jewel encrusted longsword by her waist. She is short, very short in fact. Only slightly taller than Yarrick. If she wasn’t in present company, you would think that she was a peasant girl for she looks quite plain all things considered. The other woman is in a black robe, it conceals her figure so that all you can see of the woman is her generous bust and her bodacious behind. You can’t see her face but you can see cherry-red eyes and a mysterious pendant dangling from her supple neck. ", "-Tim and Dig use all of their concentration to maintain their magical auras as something starts to try and suppress it. The woman in the black robe seems to recoil from surprise and a bit of disdain as Tim and Dig successfully defend against the dispelling magic. But even so, they are still unable to cast any simple spells.", "You feel your magic slip away from you, sapped completely (take away all remaining spell slots). Before you can react, your attention is drawn to an aged, corpulent man clothed in an exuberant manner. Saroza, with her ranger experience, could tell that the man’s coat was made from camel hair, a surcoat of fine black silk, and a hat trimmed with peacocks’ feathers. The colour of these feathers really contrasted his white facial hair and dull brown eyes. Under both his arms was a little boy, dressed in nothing but loose rags, which trudged alongside him, almost like they were puppets held by string. No doubt, this man had to be the king. After a few more moments of ceremony, the King sits himself upon the dragon shaped throne of onyx and the two women sat on the chairs to his sides. You see that the two young boys in the procession sat down by the heel of the king, their faces devoid of any emotion. The knights position themselves to the sides of the room, they each have shield and sword and stand to attention, none of them moving a muscle. The last knight to assemble in formation stands in front of you, just before the steps leading to the podium where the thrones are situated, and announces: ", "“All hail King Mikel-Gunner Dawnchaser, the true King of Allesia.”", "Everyone in the room bows, including Unit A.B.", "-After slight hesitation, the party follows suit and bows. ", "The knight returns to his position at the side of the room to join his companions. The king’s bored, brown, pupils bore themselves into your party. ", "“Enough with the ceremony. I called you all here. You are all that the people are talking about these past few weeks, so many rumour. Some of them call you heroes while others think you more dangerous than the demons.” He starts to rub the shoulders of one of the young boys while smiling through crooked yellow teeth. ", "“Go on. Which one of you is which? Who am I speaking to, exactly?”Before you can reply, Unit A.B. speaks for you. ", "“Greetings King Dawnchaser. Report: This is…”", "“I didn’t ask you, blasted machine! Mechanical wench, stop playing at being human and let the real people speak! Begone!”", "For the first time, you sense a bit of hesitation in A.B. Is it possible she… was hurt by that? She replies, “Acknowledged. Request: Bickman and the Boys, please rendezvous with Unit A.B. in the courtyard following meeting with King Dawnchaser.”", "-The party do not feel any sympathy at all for the warforged A.B. They agree to acquiesce following the meeting. Their attention is all focused on this king, who they already silently protest, especially since the king appeared to be someone with paedophilic tendencies ", "-Party introduce themselves one by one but the king simply dismisses them as mercenaries", "He doesn’t seem to acknowledge it, simply shrugs and says. ", "“Bickman and the Boys. Another mercenary group off to prove their worth against monsters in Thera. How unexciting. We all know why we are here. My daughter, that is, Princess Luxanna requested a landsmeet. All the jarls, kings, earls, emirs, sultans, races and peoples together to discuss what the country will do against this threat. She wrote to me near a month ago, warning me of a… huh… DEMONIC invasion. Do I have the facts correct?”", "-Tim tries to explain the demonic threat and the importance of the landsmeet but is promptly shut down by the arrogant king who inquires them of their journey thus far. Tim does most of the recounting and doesn’t leave much out except for of course, all of their questionable actions.", "-Something important to mention here is that the king is already quite annoyed that Bickman and the Boys decided to explore the town before answering his summons. Although he was explicit about meeting with the Boys as soon as they awoke, his words were not heeded. (Lux was supposed to have a meeting after the Boys but went first)", "He is silent the entire time. Listening to every word you say. When you finish, he sits there, brooding in silence. Then he speaks, his voice booming with authority. ", "“Let me be frank here, for I wish not to waste any more of my precious time. Are you ready? I am going to cancel the landsmeet.”", "-Every single member of the party protests against this. They forget all diplomatic protocols and argue with the king with this decision. Their words fall on death ears as...", "“SILENCE! Let me tell you the three reasons for why I have decided thus, then you may plead your case. Firstly, this demonic threat seems to be a trivial one, simply blown out of proportion. For these dark apostles that you tell me of, every single one has been bested so far by nothing more than might and magic. Why would these other lords be any different?”", "-Tim admits that contrary to the popular tales, they only barely managed to escape with their lives with each encounter. What’s more, each fight they have had plentiful help from outside sources; first the Warband deserters assisted them against Beezelbub (Dark apostle of Gluttony) and then the dragonborn assisted them against Merihim (dark apostle of Sloth). Dig says that some of them have faced Lucifer and they do not know the power of these other demons but it was certain that they wouldn’t be able to fight against them divided. The king doesn’t seem to care, let alone believe them.", "“Second. The people of North Australis have now seen the demons first hand. They flew in the skies after your blasted airship, ready to assault the city. Our grand artillery made such short work of them that there were none remaining. All of the demons felled by conventional weaponry, their bites no harsher than the bark of any other foreign invader.”", "-More explanations and protests. The king even asks them about the dracolich and when the party says that they defeated one, the king emphasises his stance that the demons are no great threat.", "“And lastly, because I do not trust you. I had my advisors run a background check on each of you. I know who you are. Dig Bickman, you were an exile from bloody Europa and ended up on our shores for reasons unknown, you never made your intention clear to anyone you travelled with. Do you deny this?”", "-Dig refuses to give much information on his background but maintains that he came to Australis to simply ‘chill’. He responded to the call of Australis when the black dragon (that turned out to be Lucifer) attacked and thus somewhat proved his loyalty there.", "“Tim of Felbourne, you were a dropout at the Academy, also for reasons unknown. You had relations with the respectable General Gunas and served alongside for a short while in the Imperial Army before disappearing for a couple of months, before appearing in a jail in O’Pertha. Your disappearance was dubious. What do you have to say?”", "-Tim doesn’t deny that he dropped out of the Academy and claims that he was following a lead on something towards West Australis, travelling through Felbourne and eventually the Badlands. However, he is unable to remember anything for the weeks or months that he had disappeared. He is unable to say much on the matter but tries convincing the King that all of these claims were irrelevant because now, more than ever, they needed to stand united.", "“Saroza. The half child. Your father a human, your mother an orc. A strange conception. A freak conception. Alas we could not find much information on you regarding your childhood, for it was found that your father left human civilisation as soon as you were born. What we did find however… was rather disconcerting. There have been rumours that your… father is a demon. Are you working with the enemy?”", "-Saroza explains her upbringing and how she met with Bickman and the Boys. She told the king that she was nothing but a simple ranger and wished for nothing but to make sure that Australis was safe. She also swore to kill her father, showing no apparent signs of connection to him. He was now with the enemy and she would not spare him. Whether this actually means Saroza does not care for her father’s fate, or whether she is just trying to hide it in front of the king, remains to be seen.", "“Styx, Styx, Styx. We found much dirt on you, oh much dirt indeed. Two counts of murder, of innocent little girls no less. Many other charges have been laid on you, public nuisance, disturbing the peace, general lollygagging. Oh but where are my manners? You were crowned a King were you not? *snort* Go on then, King, why would anyone in their right mind trust in a band of heroes that includes the likes of you?”", "-Styx finds it difficult to contain his rage when talking to the king and the rest of the party must help in holding him back. A few times, the guards are called to intervene but before it gets too out of hand, the party manage to convince the king to show mercy. I should mention that throughout this entire exchange, the king continues to molest some young boys who are sitting by his feet. ", "-Styx claims his right as a king should exempt him from these laws. He also explains, with the help of Tim, that these killings were necessary and for the good of both Thera and the Boys. He is seething with hatred for the king at this point but manages to barely reel it in. He will have his revenge.", "“You were found in the company of dragonborn, their imperial flagship no less all the way from the country of the enemy, Europa. That is very damning, Bickman and the Boys. Aside from leading the demons to us, you also brought GYMNASIANS. What are you plotting here?”", "-The party join together and talk sense to the king. They claim that Australis will fall and then borders, countries, foreign invaders etc will not matter when there is nothing left to rule. Unfortunately, the threat of Gymnasia is very real and currently they are unsure of their allegiances. The evidence is damning, however.", "-King finally relents and agrees to hold the landsmeet but on one condition. They must assist them in matters of the state. King Dawnchaser gives them 7 days to complete two tasks which his advisors will explain to them in a moment", "-But before that, three orders of business. ", "-First is Vice Admiral Prag who is brought out by some guards. He is hanging defeatd, a former shell of a man, and not the same dragonborn vice admiral that his men told stories about. He is fully ashamed for what he has done but the party feel nothing but anger at this man. He was the one responsible for the disappearance of Taylah Swiftwing and the massacre of the wyvern riders. The party decide that he should be executed but wish to carry it out themselves so the king agrees to hold him in the dungeons until the party are ready to enact this justice", "-Second, the fate of the dragonborn prisoners, numbering 700 to 800, is decided. The king will release them but they must stay outside the city with the rest of the other forces.", "-Third, a mysterious letter that the Archmage is holding, is brought to Dig for him to read. Judging from the seal, which is a skull with a dagger in the left eye, the dragonborn sorcerer recognises it as a letter from the Antipathy (probably from Ked)", "If you are reading this, then perhaps not all is lost. We are the last remnants of the army of East Australis. The demonic force were spotted building ships to try cross the Yarrum River. Scouts overheard talking amongst their higher ups that something was disrupting their ability to teleport. I would have asked more but the scouts all killed themselves out of madness, said that they couldn’t deal with the voices in their head anymore. I fear we may meet the same fate soon enough.We have delayed them a week. The leader of East Australis was a fool to not answer the Landsmeet summons sooner and now his men pay the ultimate price. Farewell and godspeed.", "-Captain Kooc", "-Dig relays all of this information to the party. This is good news. Apparently they have gained another week and that there are survivors (for now) over in the east.", "-King takes his leave while fondling the children and the knights escort him out. Reminds the party that they have seven days to complete the tasks if they are to carry out the landsmeet.", "Sabrina’s Request", "-Meet with Sabrina, who addresses the party and introduces herself as the Archmage. Recognises Tim and him being a dropout at the academy but she was not the archmage then. Says that they will not be able to use magic unless they get a permit from the academy, magic controlled by a powerful artefact in the highest level of the tower. Only granted to the select few, if you cast magic you’re fucked… not that that will be a problem because…", "-Explains the situation with magic not working properly, people experiencing strange nightmares, and people seeming strange. The party get flashbacks to the strange halflings in the alleyway near the Mechanicus Adeptus", "-Tim convinces Sabrina that he is still the same Tim fighting for Australis and that although he lost his memory, he still was a faithful member of the Academy and a student of magic. Requests for him and Dig to get their magical licenses. Doesn’t ask for Saroza as he believes that she won’t have need for it. Saroza doesn’t argue either. Sabrina grants their requests.", "-Travel to the academy in the silver quarter if you wish, but won’t need their help, you don’t seem up to the task. Leaves..", "Jomoan’s Request", "-Jomoan d’Arcabern addresses the party (reveals she is a Halfling). Actually I’m pretty sure I forgot to mention this during the session... but yeah she’s a halfling. There were many clues though, since she was only slightly taller than the midget Styx lol.", "-Apologises on behalf of the King and says that she doesn’t necessarily agree with the king’s decisions and views on things. Her thoughts on the king generally equate to ‘he is scum’. ", "-Recognises Styx and accuses him of trying to hunt down the Templarus Order, says she was there with Charles de’ Gulle. Styx remembers her instantly as well and is struggling to contain his anger. Questions her on the whereabouts of Charles but she does not relent. There is a bit of tension in the air but the party breaks them apart.", "-Explains that she believes in the party because Yarrick himself talked to her and described the threat of the demons, she can see that the situation is grave. Says that her task was that graves have been dug up and crime rate for murder has spiked, some of it may be due to paranoia from the mention of demons, but its too unnaturally high, occurring especially in the copper quarter. Can’t be necromancy because the Academy Tower would usually pick up on the magical activity so not sure to what end this is happening ", "-She also wishes to send the party on a mission to the Allesia Springs with a small band to obtain the holy grail, she truly believes they have found it this time and if it is as powerful as the legends insist, it may be pivotal against the fight with the demons. Saroza wonders whether this holy grail is like the philosopher’s stone that Master Panvon mentioned when they were in the Copper Quarter. The party agree to this, provided they still have time in the seven days. ", "-Apologises and takes her leave, making a remark that there was a grand tourney in three days, organised by the Templarus Order and that she had to tend to it. Say, would the party be interested in entering if they had time, but only if they had time, because they had to deal with these problems first."],

There, they discovered that all of these Grelivians were in fact lycanthropes; werewolves who were banished from the surrounding kingdoms of Australis. It was here that Old Man Fenrir issued them with the task of escorting a trade caravan through the forests to North Australis safely, for bands of elves had recently raided all their previous carts. ", "We now know from records written by the elven historian, Andruin, that the Boys would eventually find their way to Windar. But little is known about their short foray into the mouth of the Udakak forest or of the hours before they would come face to face with the Dirlagraun and the elves of the scout regiment.", "Today we tell a story of two of our so-called... heroes. Styx, the mighty barbarian warlord of the tuk-tuk goblin tribe who brandishes his greatsword like he brandishes his ego, the Thane of Tyr, father of all goblins (metaphorically and most likely literally). Then we have Saroza, the beautiful yet fierce half-orc ranger, wanderer, traveller, shoots-own-teammates-in-the-backerer. ", "That’s where we continue our story…", "The Caravan of the Boys", "-If you recall, my dear readers, the Boys were fated to escort a caravan to North Australis after the Grelivians had had many of their trade routes descended upon bypesky elves from the Banksia World Tree.", "-The intention was to bait the elves out and have them lead the party to the location of their famed city deep in the Udakak forest but obviously we know that didn’t go exactly to plan.", "The open glade of the Udakak Forest to the north of Grelivia is chill as the late morning fog recedes back into the sea. The recent raids from the Banksia Elves have rocked the city to its core but the people are resilient and are rebounding at an incredible rate. You’ve been tasked with securing the safe passage of the trade caravan to North Australis and while the last hour has been uneventful, your party remains alert. ", "Aside from Dig and Tim, there are six armed guards escorting you as well as the driver of the caravan itself. Both of the spellcasters have retired to the back of the caravan and are resting quietly as it has been a long day. ", "The layers and layers of trees begin to meld into one another and eventually you feel as if you are walking within an elaborate maze of green. Only Saroza is able to keep her bearings, albeit barely. She knew forests of course, could read its winding roads and hedges but something about this particular forest seemed to exude illustrious wonder. ", "One of the guards, a rather lanky fellow named Fin, sees Styx near the front of the caravan. You catch him eyeing you up and down but he does not betray a word. Instead, he begins whispering to one of the other guards and they begin chuckling under their breath like old housewives.", "-Styx is not overly appreciative of the strange looks that this human is giving him and decides to confront him about it. This confrontation involves a lot of physical abuse and overpowering of the man and little in the way of diplomacy. Saroza, who had been listening in avidly, decides to join in on the conversation. It’s not clear whether she stood up for her goblin friend out of concern or whether she was just itching to loosen up her muscles. Irrespective of reasons and motives, Bickman and the Boys remain postured at the back of the caravan, rolling their eyes in learned helplessness as they watched Saroza flung the guards around like sacks of hay.", "-I should note that these are guards from Grelivia so they are actually werewolves. This fact doesn’t seem to carry with it much weight, however, as when the greenskins descend upon him he can do nothing but whimper and beg for forgiveness.", "Fin visibly shudders. “I just… well your sword- we were talking about how the sword is twice the length of your body... that you might trip over it and impale yourself.” A long, throbbing vein plastered in the middle of Styx's forehead pulsated sporadically. ", "“You know what else is twice the length of my body? Because you're about to find out.","“It was in poor taste, friend. Please don't kill me.”", "Before the goblin can commit mass murder, Dig shouts out from the back of the caravan. ", "“Keep it down, do you really want to draw the attention of the elves? Let’s just get this job done and we can get to the Banksia World Tree in peace later.”", " -Saroza and Styx decide to let the guards off the leash for now though vow to keep a vigilant eye over them. They are a prideful pair and insults to their honour will not go unpunished.", "-The party wishes to set up camp but none are literate in the ways of the forest, save for one. They ask Saroza to find them a suitable place to stay the night and she ventures out, scouting out a body of water. She does so expertly, drinking sap from plants along the way, picking edible mushrooms and eventually finding a fresh lake suitable for drinking. ", "-However, she also sees the tracks of a mysterious beast, one that she cannot identify. It is almost like a feline’s print, except it is unusually large and behind the prints are a series of long trails as if several tentacles or tails were brushing along behind it. She is slightly unnerved but is glad that whatever this creature was, it had been long gone from the area. Satisfied, she returns to the rest of the party and directs them to the camp. All is well...", "-Until Styx decides to jump into the lake. Styx up to this point has been caked in blood, mud, shit, guts, gore and even a few stains from... himself. As he cannonballs himself into this fresh water (shortly followed by his boar, Sir Nguyen), the once pristine lake is now an oasis of filth.", "-The party complains that they now have no water to drink thanks to the goblin and now they must go thirsty for a night at least. Saroza announces that she will go to find more water by following the stream and her ranger instincts. Styx volunteers to follow her. Dig and Tim surmised that the goblin may have felt sorry for bringing this mess onto them but the truth really was that Styx simply couldn’t resist latching himself onto the poor half-orc’s leg as she strode up river.", "-Saroza and Styx enjoy a relatively peaceful stroll towards the new water source, the half-orc finding the walk in the labyrinthian forest easy (one might say a walk in the park lel). This entire time, Styx attempts to edge himself closer to closer to Saroza. Saroza has to slap the goblin this way and that in order to delay his advances. After the fifth rejection, Styx licks his wounds and swallows his pride.", "-Unfortunately upon their arrival at this new water source, the duo encounter three problems. One, they had forgotten to bring extra water skins so the only water that they could bring back would be limited to the two water skins they had on themselves. The second and third problem was Sir Styx because he, with reckless abandon I might add, decides to leap into this small lake as well. Saroza realises his intentions too late and as she reaches her hand out desperately to apprehend him, the goblin’s momentum causes them to crash into one another, tumbling to and fro before plunging into the cold water’s depths together.", "-Saroza is furious and attempts to drown Styx under the water, eyes filled with a seething rage. She waits for the bubbles rising to thesurface to slowly disappear but thankfully her consciousness kicks in and she lets the warlord enjoy a few breaths of air... before submerging him once more for good measure. ", "-Thankfully, Saroza manages to create a makeshift dam using magic and can get just enough water for the party provided they ration it very sensibly. The DM soon realises that he can get away with a lot of bullshit by using ‘magic’. ", "-They return back to camp with all the water that they could carry. This meant two water skins full of water and of course, a mouthful of water being harbored in Styx’s mouth. The goblin insisted that Saroza do the same but she flat out refused, denouncing Styx as a disgusting barbarian. This is something that Styx would take as a compliment, being an actual barbarian, so he wears the title with pride.", "-At the campfire where everyone is sat around, Styx takes Fin by the shoulders and puts his lips against his. Caught in this twisted embrace, Finn can do nothing but sob silent tears as all the foetid water festering within the goblin’s mouth seeped into his. It probably tasted of regret, sadness and death itself because he soon passes out, leaving the rest of the surviving guards to vomit around them.", "-The guards have a conversation with Saroza and Styx, asking them about Saroza’s plans with the Orcs. Saroza herself is unsure of what the future has in store for her people. She is unsure of whether she even wants the mantle. Styx on the other hand, wishes for the goblins to be respected/feared as a poeple and to be treated equally. He asks one of the guards of his thoughts on goblins. This guard responds by admitting that the goblin people were impetuous, easily stirred and reckless. However, the guard also mentions that being an outcast himself, a lycanthrope, he has nothing but empathy for the goblin people. Styx says that the guard would always be welcome wherever goblin city ended up being (goblin city is in the heart; sad reaccs only). ", "-Everyone decides to hit the hay. Some of the guards decide to hit the hay quite hard because a weary Saroza had become tired of their back-chatter, knocking the poor humans to the ground in spectacular fashion. Unfortunately, Saroza herself cannot get any rest as throughout the night for about an hour, Styx continues to try and spoon her. She chases Styx around the camp for a while before they eventually find themselves too tired to continue and begin to succumb to the warm embrace of sleep.", "Feral Screams", "Off to the north, a tremendous howl tears through the air and is immediately followed by a scream that is cut short. You can spot movement just inside the tree line. ", "-Saroza is the first to catch on to this and motions for Styx to follow her and investigate. They attempt to wake up the rest of the party, including the guards, but to no avail. They slap the faces of their companions. Hard. They do not stir. No matter what they do, they will not budge. What’s going on?", "-The tree line is several hundred feet away. They sneakily traverse their way towards the source of the sounds where they see several shapes; some look humanoid, others canine, but they all appear to be fighting", "The carnage in the trees is staggering. Two men have been torn apart and it looks like their chests have been punched clean through. Three bloody humanoid forms glare hungrily at you. They all have a canine head, and all are expelling bloody froth from their mouths. With a roar, they leap in your direction with their weapons raised!", "-Styx’s heart almost leaps out of his chest as he sees goblins here in the forest. He is confused initially as he was not aware of the existence of other goblins outside of his city in the Namati desert, yet here they were; all five of them. )He later learns of their names: San, Ita, Rium, Weet and Bix.) ", "-They engage in a fierce melee battle with these werewolves. They are only aware of the werewolves from Grelivia at this point in our tale so they are slightly concerned as to the allegiance of their newly found Grelivian allies. I think that this may have been the tipping point for Styx, who would later go on to accuse the Banksia Elves of being werewolves themselves.", "-In truth, these werewolves were the Feral Ones that Bickman and the Boys would later hear about. Unbeknownst to them, these Feral Ones were in throes of blood ecstasy from their recent kills. Alas, Saroza and Styx interrupt the werewolves as they were feastingon the hearts of their victims, and they fight back recklessly as a result.", "-The two of them easily dispatch the werewolves without breaking a sweat but are unable to prevent the savage deaths of San and Bix, who are disemboweled and torn to ribbons by the claws of these lycanthropes.", "-As Styx asks the goblins of their identity and where they came from, Saroza investigates the scene around them. ", "-The goblins freak out- and not just because two of their companions were eviscerated brutally in front of their eyes. That was trivial. What caused their sanity to flicker was when they attempted to recall their journey into the forest. It turns out that they were here on a mission to assassinate someone but for one reason or another, they could not remember who their target was. Styx presses them for more answers but gets none as they begin to scream in pain.", "-Saroza beholds multiple bodies lying strewn across the ground. To her shock and confusion, they are the bodies of both orcs and goblins; a sea of green in the tenebrous, moon lit glade. ", "-She observes that these bodies have multiple bite marks and claw wounds, and have had their hearts removed. They were probably alive when this was done. Why were there so many orcs and goblins here, laid together in the middle of a forest so far from home? Saroza didn’t recognise any of the orcs as from Orcland either so did that mean there were orc tribes that roamed all the way to North Australis? ", "-She brushes this aside and inspects the bodies further.There seemed to be brands upon these corpses and Saroza determines that there is a distinctiveaura surrounding them, like they were imprinted there by magic.She tunes into her arcane senses, instinctively knowing that something is amiss here in this mystical forest. She closes her eyes and focuses all of her senses...", "-When she opens them again, she suddenly sees their surroundings; their true surroundings. The colours of the trees, flowers, grass, everything was a shade unnatural; not like it was an inversion of their natural colours but instead a sharpened tone. It was like they were too perfect, eerily so. She puts a hand over her mouth and gasps as she realises... they had to be in the Feywild. ", "-There was no doubt in her mind; as a ranger of the King’s Forest she had heard many tales of the Feywild from the druids of her forest. They had claimed that this was another realm similar to the one of Thera but where the Fey folk resided. Few people possessed knowledge of this place, even fewer knew of how to travel there. The most defining characteristic of the Fey wild which Saroza remembered was that incomparable amounts of untapped magical energy reserves existed here. A common beggar could become an Archmage provided he could bend the energy of this plane to his will. Saroza recounts this to Styx who agrees. He remembers hearing about this realm from a mage he once held as a prisoner (after raiding his village with some other goblins in his younger days). ", "-Styx questions the goblins whether they had any knowledge of the Feywild and how they got here in the first place. All the goblins can do however is shrug because they have no recollection past chasing their target from a desert in Australis. ", "-This is when they hear a faint sound in a nearby brush. It is the sound of a fragile, whimpering young woman. ", "Huddled in the brush nearby is a grievously wounded young woman. But… she’s an orc. Clothed in scraps of clothing that at one time were likely of great value, she shows evidence of torture. Numerous bite marks and scratches cover her flesh, and her eyes glint with madness. She is giggling to herself, and as you draw close these giggles become a full-on raucous laugh.", "-Saroza does not recognise the orc at all but uses all of her medicinal knowledge to restore the woman’s health. She manages to use a calming spell to settle her mind but looking at the wound that she has sustained, it is clear that she will die soon. This doesn’t prevent Saroza from continually applying calming and healing spells on the orc woman but even Styx sees the inevitability of this orc’s death. ", "-The young orc woman’s name is revealed to beUzrul. She explains to the two that she and a group of fifty goblins and thirty orcs were waylaid on the road by the feral werewolves. They were captured three days ago and held in tiny, cramped cages. Saroza asks her about why they are here and this is where she reveals that they had been travelling to kill the Greenskin King. ", "-Styx and Saroza are flabbergasted. The Greenskin King? There was no such thing. There was a warband of course but even that was just a collection of several clans from the orcs, goblins, hobgoblins and (formerly) bugbears. Was there someone even greater than Styx and Saroza that could reunite all the clans? Madness.", "-Saroza asks her to explain further; what clan was she from, how she got here and if she knew who the Greenskin King was. Urzul stares at Saroza strangely and admits that they followed the Greenskin King through a portal after he allegedly sold them to the demons and their previous warlords perished. Upon entering this Feywild, however, she seemed to have forgotten his name. The only thing that she remembers about the king is that he looked remarkably similar to Styx. This makes Styx do a double take. ", "-Urzul continues talking about how Australis is overrun by demons and that the last remnants of the Warband were the last force trying to hold out against the abyssal army only to be sold out by their own leader. ", "-This makes no sense to Saroza and Styx. Since they had departed from the Namati desert, ", "it had only been a couple of days. The demon invasion could not have advanced this far so rapidly and what’s more, there was no plausible way for this sort of event to go unnoticed even though they were in the Udakak Forest (well, the Feywild version of the Udakak Forest at least) What’s going on? ", "-Urzul adds to them with her dying breath that they need to “follow the white gravel.” Before they can get any more answers, Urzul expires. Saroza continues pressing against her chest, desperately trying to revive the orc even though she is fully aware of the futility. As Styx had done with the rest of the corpses, he closes the eyes of Urzul and says that they will meet with him in Valhalla (wtf lol). ", "-Styx consorts with the surviving goblins and declares to them that they will be their new warlord and that together they will travel to Valhalla together. The goblins are inspired by this and cannot explain why they feel compelled to follow Styx but pledge their undying loyalty and servitude. ", "-Saroza and Styx take it upon themselves to go kill this Greenskin King. Even though they are unsure of what Urzul had meant about Thera being overrun by demons, they decide that it is best they meet this King to solve the issue once and for all. After all, they knew they were in a strange realm and unable to find their way back to camp so what else could they do? Furthermore, there was something strange about this Greenskin King himself, something strangely familiar... ", "-They set off on their way, deeper into the Fey Forest. ", "Fey Forest", "You venture deeper into the forest, now aware that strange magic is afoul here. You stick on the gravel path which snakes and coils deeper into the forests’ centre.For reasons unknown, the rest of the caravan escort team are unable to hear you or are stuck in a deep trance. Whenever you try to retrace steps back to your caravan you continue to feel drawn in this particular direction, like you are being allured by the salacious whispers of the trees. ", "-Saroza comments about her uneasiness as they continue. She begins to theorise about the concept of parallel universes and time travel. Styx dismisses these theories and snorts with indifferent yet deep down in the cavernous recesses of his mind, he cannot ignore the possibility", "Some thirty feet ahead of you is a large pile of writhing animals. They are emitting shrill cries of pain and anguish and seem to be stuck together. In the pile you can see rats, a fox, a rabbit, a coyote, a few snakes, and more. The animals appear to be stuck in more ways than one. Some of them look like they have had their tails tied together, others look like some kind of foul liquid has cemented them to their neighbour.", "-The goblins travelling with Styx are just as taken aback as the ranger and barbarian. Styx, who would usually see the humour in a situation such as this, finds himself slightly unnerved. The barbarian is truly not accustomed to this place and he cannot understand where this feeling of unease is stemming from but he does not like it. Saroza is likewise disturbed but attempts to rescue the animals from this predicament.", "-Saroza begins to try and unravel the creatures, untangling the pile little by little. Styx assists her by pouring water from his pack intermittently on the animal pile. Saroza’s face contorts slightly when she identifies the ‘foul liquid’ as a mix of excrement that has hardened to a nearly cement-like rigidity. Saroza’s first attempt at delicately untangling the appendages of these creatures fails and she gets bitten and scratched. This doesn’t deter her from another attempt as she focuses herself, allowing her natural nimbleness and dexterity to take over. She eventually succeeds in freeing all the animals. ", "-Once the animals are free, most of them scamper away. However, one fox remains on the path and yips at the characters in thanks. What happens next fills Ita, Rium and Weet with envy. The fox metamorphosises to a beautiful and elegant fox-woman, uttering a word of thanks in a strange tongue (Fey?) before giving Styx a quick kiss on his lips. This is hardly sufficient for a manly goblin like Styx, so he grabs her by the waist and presses her against his muscular frame, slipping in his own strange tongue (Goblin) for a steamy kiss(+10 maximum hp and +1 strength lmao)", "-The fox-woman disappears in a blink and leaves the characters stunned. Was she an illusion? Did any of this even happen? They trudge along, Styx obviously happy with himself. Next to him, still following the white gravel road prescribed to them by Urzul, Saroza betrays a modicum of... jealousy?", "-They travel further for several moments, it seems like they are getting closer to their target. They can feel it within the fibres of their being. They can soon make out the sounds of a fastpaced, high-pitched conversation in the near vicinity. The goblins, Styx, and Saroza hide behind a large boulder to observe some strange beings in a ring conversing in this strange tongue. ", "-The voices are unmistakably sylvan in origin and very likely fey. Saroza doesn’t know how she knows this. Although Hugh Myrin had tried desperately several times to teach Saroza the spell to Detect Languages, she simply could not understand the spell’s workings. Yet here, with the bountiful stores of magic dancing around them, teasing them like a courtesan’s fleeting whispers, she simply understood. ", "-The creatures that they first see are small, skittish. They looked incredibly tiny, no bigger than perhaps a human forearm. Saroza mentions that they look like “quick things”. Because they are whispering to each other from their furtive positions, Styx mistakes her for saying “quicklings”. The name sticks and they continue to spy on these strange beings. ", "-Saroza listens intently, picking up small snippets of the conversation between these quicklings. They seem to be arguing intently about whether they should trust “the Green One”. ", "-After a few moments, a deep, gravelly voice speaks – though its voice is intermixed with small yips like that of a dog. It is a werewolf communicating in broken common, telling the Fey to stop defending the Greenskin King (the Green One!). As their conversation unfolds, more is made clear to the adventurers. It turns out that this Greenskin King had taken the Fey King, named Oberon, hostage. In exchange for the Fey King’s safety, the Greenskin King had demanded the Fey Folk to protect him from anyone who happened to pursue him. The werewolves who were here in the Feywild already seemed to have a fractured relationship with the Fey and this seemed to be the last straw. Howls and warcries ensue, then they begin to attack each other.", "-Saroza and Styx are about to jump in but Styx advises that they should wait to see what will happen. Saroza agrees to this but says that they should try to speak with the Fey as they are not fully aware of their intentions. ", "-The werewolves are slashed at multiple times from these Quicklings. The name is apt because these creatures dance across the battlefields at blinding speeds, stabbing, riposting and slashing with their daggers at the vital points of these werewolves. They cannot even react as flashes of blue (oh yeah, forgot to mention these quickling are a shade of blue) annihilate them one by one. ", "-When the battle is over, Saroza tries to whisper something to Styx but accidentally steps on a twig. Their cover is blown and Saroza jumps down from the ledge to speak to the quicklings but it seems that these Fey are in no mood to talk as they too are descended upon.", "-The battle is unusually difficult. In a contest of strength, none of these minuscule creatures could hold a candle (literally) to Styx. But these guys were fast, faster than what a mortal’s eye could detect. It takes Saroza all of her concentration to bring her katanas to good use, she manages to bisect about three of them single-handedly while the three goblins under Styx’s command keep one of them busy. Styx miraculously catches one of the Quicklings with his barehands as he foregoes his weapons, the big hefty blade being much too unwieldly against foes of this size.", "-The group interrogate the quickling and from it, learn more about the Greenskin King and the situation with the Fey King. They seem to detest him but fear him for he appears to be rather strong and in league with demons from another ‘time that has not come to pass.’ Styx shakes the quickling down for information about the greenskin king’s appearance. This is when the quickling reveals that he bears a striking resemblance to both Saroza and Styx but adds that most of ‘you guys look the same anyway’. ", "-Styx makes a deal with the quickling. They will save this Fey King from the Greenskin King but in return, wish for the help of the Fey against the demons. The quickling promises to talk to the king personally when he is saved and so Saroza and Styx begin to depart for the greenskin king’s camp where he is apparently being held. One last thing Styx does is command Ita, Rium and Weet to escort the quickling to nearby safety before they save the king. Then, they follow the white gravel path once more.", "The gravel path eventually leads you into a large clearing. A pleasant bit of light shines into the clearing ahead. You can detect the lightly sweet smell of flowers in bloom. The space to either side of the path is full of brambles and briars; it appears that your path is explicitly forward. ", "-Saroza and Styx suddenly get caught in a trance and cannot budge a single muscle.They are held by an intense magical force that causes them to stop dead in their tracks. A single, humming voice that is melodious and alluring speaks to them in their mind.", "“You must keep this after you give it away, but it has no inherent value. What am I?” ", "-The correct answer to this is “your word”. Eventually, Styx manages to get the correct answer but may have suffered minor brain damage from overthinking.", "-Then another message is heard:", "“I have rivers without water, forests without trees, mountains without rocks and towns without houses. What am I?” ", "-The correct answer to this is “a map”. Saroza is the one who answers this without any trouble.", "-They receive a third and final message, this time in a velvety voice like that of a beautiful maiden: ", "“You have answered my riddles dearie, know that I will be watching you. You should be kind enough to come visit me when you are done playing in the mud, you know. Though I suspect we will not meet yet for some time. For now, hear my name and weep. Lilith, the whore of Babylon, the dark apostle of Lust!” ", "-They are taken aback. It seemed that they had briefly encountered the mad gibbering of one of these dark apostles, this one claiming to be the demonic representative of Lust. They carry forward with heavy hearts once more. ", "The stone path winds between the towering trees of the old growth part of the Udakak Forest. The shadows grow long and with it, you can hear the low growling and snapping sounds of a large creature finishing a meal.", "-Saroza motions for Styx to stay his ground as she listens in to the sound. The sound is like that of a low growl, purring that reverberates in her ear. She can just barely make out the soft point of contact between a creature’s paws and the grassy ground, followed by a continuous rustling sound akin to someone dragging a rope across the floor. Then, it strikes... ", "-Saroza and Styx are knocked to the ground, being heavily injured. They reach for their weapons and stumble to their feet until another even louder roar is heard from behind them in the forest. Whatever attacked them (it was the dirlagraun obviously but they have no knowledge of this creature yet), seems to flee off after hearing this noise", "-They wisely choose not to pursue and instead continue towards the camp. But not until Styx stumbles upon a torn letter that is found on the ground. He happens to stumble over it, it must have been dropped by someone who had recently traversed here. ", "-The letter reads:", "“I bloody miss my mother and father. They left to fight against the demons one day and never came back. What do I do? Who am I? What is my place in this world? Perhaps if I was to travel to… ” (the rest of the letter seems to have been torn in half) ", "-Styx stands there in horror as he slowly pieces the evidence together but cannot process it. Was this greenskin king his son? If so, who was the mother? His eyes widen in horror as he looks up at Saroza. Demons that had overrun Thera, the warband consisting of orcs and goblins under one king’s banner, the Feywild... was this their son from another... Styx refuses to think on it further. Saroza snatches the loathsome manuscript and arrives at the same conclusion but refuses to acknowledge it. The gravity and implications of this was too much for the both of them to bare for the moment. Their only path right now was forward again.", "The Greenskin King", "-Saroza and Styx reach the location of the Greenskin camp and immediately see that there are prisoners here. ", "This part of the forest has a very dense canopy and has quite dim lighting. The temperature here is much colder than the rest. Frost covers the stones and the vegetation crunches underfoot as they walk into the main entrance. As the two of them progress deeper into the camp, they begin to notice small bundles of sticks. The bundles take a more humanoid shape and grow in size, the largest of them being about twelve inches from top to bottom, and all of them are hanging from tree branches. After two miles of this, they come to a clearing. Lashed to a stand of trees are two very large humanoid effigies. Standing almost fifteen feet tall, they are quite an imposing sight. They are aghast when they witness their unmistakable visage upon these effigies that have been made to perfect likeness. These monuments have been dedicated to the two of them, and judging by the intricate decorations and carefully manicured flowerbeds lining the ground of these structures, it is clear that whoever erected these has immense respect for Styx and Saroza.", "Several tall stones stand in the open space, their features long since erased by the elements but still bearing a vaguely humanoid appearance. Between them can be seen a number of weather-worn stones, some of which have goblin and orc prisoners shackled to them – and evidence of the greenskin king. The stench of death and decay hangs heavy in the air. As you take in the environment, one of the prisoners calls out to you. ", "“HELP! They’ll be back soon – you have to get us out of here!” ", "-At the back of the camp, sitting in chains made of a strange metal, is the fey king Oberon. He looks regal, a little plump, grey hair and strange otherwordly eyes. Styx drops his boar blade beside the entrance of the camp when he enters. In his mind, his only objective is to free the Fey King and hopefully negotiate something for the Boys back at... wherever they were now. Styx doesn’t know what he’s going to do if he sees what could possibly be his own son. For the first time in his life, Styx is uncertain of how to act. Styx reaches Oberon and tries talking to him but the king continues speaking in a language that Styx cannot understand. In frustration, Styx manages to break apart the chains, to which allows the Fey King to phase out. Unfortunately, this means that Styx is unable to carry out any negotiations so he hopes that the quickling survivor sees more success.", "-Meanwhile, Saroza wakes up one of the orc prisoners and demands to know who the greenskin king is. The orc screams that the greenskin king is a monster and that he made a deal with a demon named Abbadon which caused the warband to be destroyed or enslaved to the demons. The orc prisoner’s eyes go wide with shock as she comes to realise that Saroza and Styx are...“Mother? Father?” A voice rings out from behind Styx and Saroza. It is a commanding voice but one drenched in immeasurable sorrow and uncertainty, a voice resplendent in despair. ", "Styx presses both palms against his eyes and grits his teeth. He tries to turn but it feels like his legs are failing him, threatening to give out at any moment. He doesn't want to believe it. Saroza likewise sags to the ground, trying to utter something but unable to formulate anything with her disturbed breathing. ", "It is unmistakable.", "Jet black hair tied in a neat bundle, a left eye of a penetrating brown like Saroza's with his right saturated in an effulgent red. He resembles a goblin somewhat but was much too tall. He looks like an orc but he bore a slightly uncharacteristic gait, shoulders were perhaps a bit too narrow and his feet a tad too large. Behind this man is a group of six orcs, bigger than the rest. They seem ready to guard this man with their lives.Now the stranger speaks again, but this time it is more certain, more melancholic. ", "“Mother and father. It can't be. You...” tears begin to well in his eyes. ", "“They killed you.”", "-The stranger calls himself Sarotyx.", "-Styx and Saroza learn that the Greenskin King has been their son all along, from another timeline or dimension or plane. In this other reality, Saroza and Styx had lost everything. The Boys were defeated and demons overrun the entire plane of Thera. The only surviving rebels were the Warband and so Saroza and Styx being the only survivors of the original Boys set out on a mission of vengeance. They never returned.", "-They left Sarotyx when he was only a child. He didn’t understand or rather could not begin to comprehend why they left him behind. In some ways, what Saroza and Styx did was selfish because they allowed their own desire for revenge beget their son’s spiral into desperation.", "-Sarotyx, a small child, inherited the control of the warband. He says that he fought long and hard for the people but the ending was inevitable. The demons would take over and no matter how hard they fought, there would be no way out of this certain doom. So he struck a deal with Abbadon, knowing that demons always kept their word. Sarotyx pleaded with Abbadon, making him promise that this people would never die. Abbadon agreed but abused a very glaring loophole. The people of the warband were now safe. They would never die, sure. Literally. The demons took all of them prisoners and kept them alive with sick and twisted magic. They became the playthings of the demons and reduced to something less than slaves. Inadvertently, Sarotyx had damned his people to a fate worse than death. ", "-Sarotyx cries and says that he wished for it all to end. He stumbles over to his mother and father who he embraces. This large, lumbering warlord who was the King of all Greenskins now looking like a helpless child. He asks his parents for one last favour: “Kill me.”", "-Sarotyx promises that all the prisoners will be free. But his last wish is to duel either Styx or Saroza to prove his valour and strength. Styx offers a contest of strength but Sarotyx points out that he has been corrupted by the demons (as evident by his red eye) and that his demonic strength would easily overpower him, unfortunately. Surprisingly, Styx does not seem to be offended by this. He is overcome instead by uncertainty. Styx looks to Saroza, who agrees to duel her child in a pure melee battle. ", "-Everything is silent before they clash. Then, both mother and son roar their battlecries before charging at each other with cold blades and hearts. Saroza wields her two katanas, one of them being the famed Yamato. Styx is shocked when he sees Sarotyx wielding a boar blade exactly identical to his own (it is actually the boar blade from the Styx in that time cycle before the Ancient One does the redo). They fight with each other, Sarotyx wielding his father’s blade with an unexpected grace. Saroza focuses all of her attention on dodging and parrying the greatsword with incredible feats of acrobatics. She is struck a few times with grazing hits and the sheer force of the swings. She compliments Sarotyx here and there on his fighting skills and learns that Sarotyx had been trained by someone he referred to as “Uncle Sashi” (Musashi). ", "-Eventually, Saroza overpowers Sarotyx. Sarotyx goes for a downwards helm strike with the pommel of his blade but is stopped short as Saroza digs her off-hand katana into his abdomen. There is silence all around save for Styx who lets out a faint sigh of pain, followed by a low groan from Sarotyx who falls onto both knees. The boar blade drops shortly after, causing a loud echo to reverberate in the whole camp. Saroza lets go of the katana in her left hand and embraces her son, who is bleeding all over her cloak. Sarotyx manages to hug his mother in return in a weak grip and whispers faintly into her ear, “Thank you, mother.” Saroza breaks contact and screams as she wields Yamato with both hands and swipes at Sarotyx’s exposed neck. Then he is quiet.", "-A lot of crying and sadness.", "-More crying.", "-They hold a funeral service for him, it is very sombre and nothing but respect is given to the Greenskin King even though just shortly moments before they had hated him with a passion. In his death he had revived his honour. ", "-His body is cremated as he is burned in a funeral pyre, everyone watching the flames burn strongly to the skies of this enchanted forest. Sarotyx lays with his boar blade against his chest upon a beautiful stone tablet. ", "-A few hours pass and Styx moves forward to the remains. He collects the ashes in a vial and tucks them into his belt, vowing that he will spread his ashes atop the highest point of Goblin City. He is beside himself with grief. Saroza remains by his side and the two embrace. Maybe there is a chance for the both of them, after all at romance, after everything is over, or...", "-The quickling returns with a pixie, a strange looking female pixie that has an extremely high pitched voice. There are also the three goblins, Ita, Rium and Weet standing with them. The pixie explains to Styx and Saroza that they are in the Feywild but not physically, only their spirit has been transported somehow. The pixie says that she will be able to transport them back to the material plane but the orcs and goblins that have come here have been here too long and tasted of its food and so forth. If they ever set foot on mortal soil again they will perish. Even knowing this, however, the three goblins vow to follow Styx anyway and say they are aware of the risks. Styx cries again and promises that he will lead them into Valhalla and they will hunt forever.", "-The quickling promises to get word to Oberon as soon as possible. The pixie sprinkles some dust into his palm and blows it into the faces of Styx, Saroza and the three goblins.

They feel strange, like they’re trying to remember something but can’t seem to place what it is. This annoys Saroza greatly because it seems to be on the tip of his tongue. They find themselves holding each other when they come to and immediately Saroza pushes the goblin away, wondering why they were so close to one another. She feels repulsion when she looks at the goblin yet at the same time a certainindescribable emotion of longing.", "-Styx is confused, finding now three small humanoid skeletons beside him and of course, strapped to his belt, a vial of ashes. He weeps without knowing why. ", "-Saroza sees the small vial too and asks Styx why he carries it, how long he has had it for. Styx doesn’t know. They look at the ashes and cannot help but feel overwhelming sadness, like they’ve lost something they’ve cared about, something they truly loved.

Towering dragon statues are perched majestically atop the ramparts of the city’s main gate, overlooking the majestic Ivory Keep. While the Templarus Order and The Academy remain vigilant for perils within and outside its walls, allied forces set themselves down on the wall’s perimeter. Tents and encampments dot the landscape and from within the city you can make out the faint dins and chatter of orcs, humans, lycanthropes, elves and the like. War is coming.", "After having narrowly escaped the crash landing of the Dragonfly, the Europan flying battleship, the party found themselves nursed back to perfect health in the Gold Quarter hospital by a Warforged. It, or she, was named Unit A.B. and appeared to be a peculiar hybrid of metal and flesh crafted by the hands of Master Panvon, who resided in the Mechanicus Adeptus in the Copper Quarter slums.", "Last time, Bickman and the Boys met with King Dawnchaser himself to discuss the landsmeet and the future of Australis. The King was not a big fan of the Boys, to say the least, denouncing them as mercenaries and seeing the demons as a trivial threat. Although he initially opposed the landsmeet, he instead offered to reconsider if Bickman and the Boys could complete two tasks within seven days.", "One such task involved the strange disappearance of bodies and reported unusual behaviours from some citizens. The other was an investigation into the nightmares running rampant throughout the city and the instability of magic in Windar as well.", "What manners of twisted, antediluvian horrors await our ill-fated heroes in this city? What foul machinations have the demons set loose upon the land? That is where we continue our story for today…", "Discussing Morality with a Machine", "You have just concluded your eventful conversation with the King and his two advisors; Jomoan d’Arcabern and Sabrina. Two Templarus knights come out to escort you out of the throne room and you now find yourselves in the courtyard, breathing the clean, fresh air of the Australis summer. ", "From the corner of your eye, you are approached by none other than the warforged service unit, A.B, with her long, flowing hair bleached white, slender frame and fair, gleaming skin. She regards you with a semi-blank stare and those among you with keen perception notice gears turning within her pupils, a subtle reminder that despite her appearances, she is not truly human. ", "She says, “Analysing. Unit A.B. detects low levels of satisfaction within the party following encounter with King Dawnchaser. Question: How did the meeting progress?”", "-This truly stumps the party. Such a profound question could surely not be answered by mere mortals such as themselves. If the party took 15 more minutes to answer, Unit A.B. was legally allowed to leave. Thankfully, they manage to blurt out varying degrees of ", "“yeah, good”. ", "Her eyes begin to whir again as she processes your response. This time however, you swear that you notice a slight tremor from her as she speaks. ", "“Acknowledged. Question: King Dawnchaser referred to this Unit as a ‘quote: freak playing at being alive. End quote’. What does this mean?”", "-Tim dashes all hope of human and robot coexistence by denying her the gift of life. The wizard makes a clear distinction between an AI simulacrum of life and actual, living, alive, life. More or less, he asks Unit A.B. to define at which point an imitation would start to become the real thing.", "-Unit A.B. responds by posing him a similar question: ", "“If someone steals a loaf of bread from you and eats it, when does it cease to become yours and become theirs?”", "-Tim smirks. ", "“Touche.”", "-Unit A.B. seems unsatisfied and undergoes further processing. Keep in mind that this construct seems to be rapidly learning and evolving. It seems to take every thing that Bickman and the Boys to heart, albeit an artificial one.", "“Unit A.B. does not understand. Scanning lexicon library. Life; a condition that includes the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Unit A.B. possesses all of these qualities to varying degrees. Therefore, Unit A.B. is alive.” ", "-Tim remains adamant in crushing a warforged’s dream. ", "“No, you are not alive. You are merely a replication of life processes, to varying degrees.”", "-It seems the rest of the Boys want no part in this philosophical discussion. Although Tim appears to have a predisposed cynicism towards all things machinery on account of his inordinatefondness of the arcane, the rest of the party members remain neutral regarding Unit A.B.", "Whether or not she has understood your words or not is a mystery. Her piercing blue eyes continue to look past you. Then, she appears to change the subject. ", "“Unit A.B. has something for Tim of Felbourne.” She hands out a vial containing some sickly green blood. ", "“This is Hag’s blood. Lux instructed this Unit to deliver this to the wizard. You will require this for a procedure with Master Panvon to repair your missing foot.”", "-Tim thanks the Warforged and the party begin to discuss their next moves. The wisest course of action was to find out more information on these quests from the respective headquarters of Sabrina and Jomoan. However, there was also the issue of Tim’s foot and (although currently forgotten by the party) Saroza’s brand which was acquired from her dream of the dark apostle, Pride.

The transmitter is already on, speak directly into it.” This is followed by a harsh chortle.(General Gunas): ", "“Oh, I see. *clears throat* It’s been a long time since we spoke, Bickman and the Boys. It’s Dilmah.”", "-Party are elated to hear General Dilmah’s voice. The last time they saw him was when they left Galkoorlie following the defence of its walls against the warband. He had left with the rest of the Namati forces to gather reinforcements from the Urulu Mountain Dwarves before rendezvousing in Windar with the Boys.", "“Thank the gods you are all safe. We all saw that flying ship crashing from the skies. You’ve got some explaining to do. Anyway, I don’t exactly like speaking through this machine so…”", "“IT’S NOT A MACHINE, IT’S A WARFORGED SERVICE UNIT NAMED A.B. AND SHE-”", "“I’m at the Dragon’s Hoard, it’s a tavern in the Copper Quarter. Ked’s with me too... We’ve got a lot to talk about. Try not to delay, especially you Tim.”", "“END TRANSMISSION. Unit A.B. knows the direction to the Dragon’s Hoard. Question: What will be the Boy’s course of action?”", "-Dig remarks that they should delay, especially Tim. The party agrees. DM does not agree.", "-The train arrives for inevitable railroading", "-Party miraculously decides that the best course of action would be to first meet up with Ked and Dilmah at the Dragon’s Hoard. Dig and Saroza hope that Panvon will be there with them as they have lingering questions in the back of their minds concerning his supposed dead wife, Abby ", "-Party follow Unit A.B. into the Copper Quarter.", " ", "JOURNEY INTO THE COPPER QUARTER", "Before you leave, you have one last glimpse of the surroundings. The courtyard of the gold quarter is picturesque, golden dragons coil around the marble pillars that line up the walkway out of the throne room. The floor here is an elaborate array of quartzite stone that has been painstakingly placed down by hand and the rows of flowers and neatly trimmed hedges that populate this spacious area seemed to have been handpicked to illustrate the extravagance of this area of the city.", "That’s why when you follow Unit A.B. under the marble archways out into the Copper Quarter of Windar, you feel like you’ve stepped out into another country. As you step through to the grey streets of you are reminded of the poverty everywhere you look. Aside from the constant smell of shit, possibly horse manure from the stables nearby or even human faeces, it is the faces of the people that get your attention the most. The people here seem so dreary and worn, with desperation cemented on their emaciated faces that they look almost as grey as the dull roads and crumbling buildings surrounding them. Several street urchins and strumpets approach your party as you walk, either begging for money or for a service in return for money. ", "At one point, you see a couple of Halflings, they look to be in their teens, steal a loaf of bread from a meagre-looking street stall. They try to run but don’t make it very far on account of their short legs and they are currently being beaten with a stick by the old man who runs the stall. The two halflings catch your eye and begin pleading for your help.", "-Saroza and Styx are the types of people, or greenskins, that like to act first and question later. Whilst the baker is busy chasing after these two halfling boys, Saroza busies herself by rushing to the run down stall and stealing a loaf of bread herself. Admittedly, she does feel quite bad in doing so, seeing the state of this part of the city, but decides that it’s the right thing to do. Wait, not really, actually I don’t even know why Saroza does half the things she does", "-I do understand why Styx does what he does however. Styx apprehends the baker and proceeds to throw him into the air three times. He doesn’t catch him on the third throw and judging by the resounding crack coming from the baker, it is safe to say that the baker will probably have a debilitating injury for the rest of his life", "-On a side note, WHAT THE FUCK. I mean, these halfling boys could have been wealthy kids simply targeting this baker because they felt like ruining a poor, plump baker’s life. Perhaps the baker was actually a friend of theirs and the kids were just playing a practical joke. But the party never discover any of this because most of the party just go in NO QUESTIONS ASKED EVERY TIME WHILE THE REST OF THE PARTY JUST STANDS THERE THINKING WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE HEROES OR BANDITS AND WHAT THE FUCK MY LIVING BREATHING WORLD HAS BECOME A LEGO BLOCK SET FOR GREENSKIN TODDLERS TO SMASH AROUND AND ALL MY NPCS ARE JUST OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACROBATIC/ATHLETIC FEATS AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH FUUUUUUUUUCK", "-Ok, rant over.", "-Party continue moving forward.", "PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION BY A MACHINE", "-Continue walking past the scene towards the tavern, can just make it out in the far distance. It is about midday. ", "-Unit A.B. (smugly) asks Tim again, “If someone steals a loaf of bread from you and eats it, when does the bread itself cease to be yours and becomes theirs?”", "-Tim admires the warforged’s wit as much as he admires Lux, which is not very ", "-Unit A.B. presses the question, “Is justice a human construct or is it independent of humans?”", "-Tim decides that justice is undoubtedly a human construct. Unit A.B. looks as if she wants to disagree; but instead processes the information that Tim has given her. ", "-These responses may or may not have a profound impact on her development later on in the story, provided one of the greenskins don’t cleave her in half first.", "LUTE AND LOOT", "-From behind, a man pushes past the party, bumping into Saroza, telling them to hurry if they want to see the show ", "-Party enquires: what show?", "-They rush to where there is a huge crowd gathering and hear: ", "“Come one, come all, to Dardy’s Exotic Animal Extravaganza” or something along the lines of this", "-There are lot of exotic creatures here, a basilisk, unicorn and several other mysterious beasts that even Bickman and the Boys have not been exposed to", "-There is a huge crowd here and the party find it hard to even get a good glimpse but after some hearty shoving and pushing they finally make their ways near the front of this makeshift stage. Styx leaps onto Saroza’s shoulder so that he can get a good view of the spectacle.", "-Dardy himself is quite a handsome fellow, pleasant looking face, good physique, a devilish moustache and regal-looking purple robes. His voice is a bit grating at times, sure, but he definitely looks like a showman", "-The first creature to be shown is a unicorn. Tim is interested in getting a closer look at this creature. The only unicorns that the party had encountered thus far was in the King’s Forest, so he was curious as to how this peculiar man named Dardy had managed to bring a creature from so far away", "-Digging into the magic of Barnabus as well as his own, he studied the unicorn meticulously. What he saw made him beyond disappointed. The unicorn was no more a unicorn than he a giant. The horn had been stuck on a poor, regular, donkey with some sort of resin and the white, gleaming coat of this unicorn had been some sort of prestidigitation. ", "-Tim gives an awkward look at Dardy who gives him an uneasy smile while he leads the unicorn away back into its cage. He then brings out a basilisk and starts talking of its mysterious powers and ability to turn those it looks at into stone. As such, he has covered its eyes in cloth.", "-Dig is also skeptical and walks forward to investigate the basilisk. His Eye of Melora reacts and although it does not dispel the illusion, it does show in his mind the true form of this so called Basilisk: an overgrown lizard made even larger with illusory magic. Once more, Dig stared at Dardy with raised eyebrows. ", "-Dardy, sensing his cover about to be blown, offered a sturdy sum to any of the onlookers to stare into the basilisk’s eyes directly. Saroza herself decided to throw her own ten gold pieces in to whoever was brave enough. She believed that there was no one foolish enough to risk such a venture, even though she herself was aware that the creature was nothing but a sham. ", "-Unfortunately, the allure of such a large sum to these people soaked in poverty overrides even their innate fear of death. Saroza realises that she has bitten a bit more than she can chew and also walks forward to challenge Dardy. This gives Dardy a new idea: a fist fight between Saroza and a willign challenger for all of the gold. (Some representatives from the gambling den gather some extra prize money for the winner)", "-One of the stronger looking men who had volunteered for this basilisk challenge is an apprentice to a blacksmith in the bronze quarter. He seems ready to rumble. ", "-The fight is extremely one sided. Saroza gets some good hits in to be sure, but she is knocked flat on her ass and laid out on the stage. She attempts to grab the opponent with her legs but fails to do so, overshooting in the process and getting pounded on the ground by this no-name stranger. ", "-One of the representatives gives her a ten count, which she barely fails. In frustration, she gets her bow and arrow and shoots the representative in the head... KALEB THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE, YOU CAN’T JUST GET AWAY FROM MURDER", "-Dardy senses that the whole scene is going to hell and bolts away to the Dragon’s Hoard which happens to be close by. Tim pursues the man, somehow managing to keep up with his one good leg. ", "-Saroza and Styx are meanwhile apprehended by a handful of guards. Dig comes in to help talk his way out of the situation but even this is brushed aside by the guard. Saroza had just committed a capital offence and she was to await the king’s justice.", "-Thankfully, a familiar face appears from within the Dragon’s Hoard. General Gunas. He uses his diplomatic immunity to save Saroza from any severe punishments. The fact that Dilmah seems to have a modicum of power within this city is surprising but Saroza shouldn’t rely on this to save her in the future. There will be a reckoning.", "-The party follow General Gunas into the tavern.", "The Dragon’s Hoard ", "This tavern looks run down... hardly surprising considering the state of the copper quarter. The sign is hanging off the doorframe by its last nail and the letters have all but faded out. Before you enter, Unit A.B. asks you all. ", "“Question: Do Bickman and the Boys wish for Unit A.B. to remain with them?”", "-The party wishes her to stand by the door", "-The interior of the tavern: dimly lit, rot has set in on some of the tables, loose floorboards in places, strong musty smell", "-There’s a lot of poor folk here just drinking, some labourers who are busy chatting up barmaids", "-Saroza is still filled with adrenaline from the fight and the murder that she just committed. Buys everyone a round.", "-As for Dardy, he is being restrained by a wall of force spell that Tim uses. He can’t seem to escape the immense power generated from the spell. Saroza even tries to spill a drink on him out of spite but the force wall also causes the liquid to sizzle and evaporate upon contact.", "-The party decide to go upstairs where Ked is supposedly waiting for them. They take Dardy with them after deciding him too much of a trouble to be let loose upon the city. Dardy retorts by claiming Saroza to be more of a menace to society than he but the party largely ignore this.", "The door swings shut behind you and you find yourselves in a large room with several tables that are vacant, except for one. There sits with his arms crossed, barely moving a muscle as you enter the room. The leader of the Antipathy waves his hand lazily to greet you.", "-Dilmah and Ked engage in pleasantries; also enquire as to the identity of Dardy Singh", "-Dardy doesn’t reveal much about himself except that his parents were from Gymnasia and that he has travelled abroad in Europa. When pressed on specifics he refuses to answer, preferring to remain mysterious for the moment ", "-It should be mentioned that the party don’t seem too interested in learning about Dardy’s motivations, interests, background, history, origin... anything really. There are two reasons that could possibly account for this: (1) Dardy may not survive the encounter with the demons, (2) The fact that when they told Dardy that their overall quest involved slaying demons and Dardy DIDN’T IMMEDIATELY TURN TAIL AND RUN says more than enough for Bickman and the Boys. ", "Dilmah reveals:", "-Dilmah and the other allies went to rally the dwarves and only got the support of 200 because of the ancient grudge for the humans stealing their lands, their king, king Hrothgar refused to help", "-Grundle was here earlier but went to the blacksmith to work on new enhancements for Saroza and Styx’s weapons, really wanted to see them two", "-All of the supporting armies have been thrown outside the walls in makeshift camp, the king allowed only the higher ups to traverse the town, says that most of their friends will either be in the camp or in certain places in the city. ", "-Dilmah tells them the state of the people is one of distrust and fear. It is spreading like a virus and causing many to do stupid things. Rumours that people are changing, not themselves, and nightmares have been gripping the city as of late. ", "Ked reveals:", "-Ked interrupts and asks them about the state of the landsmeet. ", "-Asks them what they think of Gymnasia and the party admit that although Gymnasia may be allied with the demons, they can’t afford too much attention to them for the time being. Ked says that he has a plan but it turns out that he was fishing for something from Bickman and the Boys. It becomes apparent that no one has any idea, including Ked, on how to address the potential Gymnasia threat", "-Ked gives them the update on the rift and that Doran contacted him, saying that he found out the rift was instrumental in defeating the demons. But not only is it a tear in the dimension, but a tear in time. But that was over a week ago, hasn’t heard from him since. He usually doesn’t cut off communication like that.", "-Mentions that there are still resistance forces to the East holding the demons from crossing but it won’t be long before they fall", "-Ked reminds them of their obligation to support the labourers. Continued help will require the party to keep faith. ", "-Dilmah has little information but offers to help in any way that he can. Can deliver messages to the rest of their companions, even the elves that they met recently. He says he will update the rest of the companions on their journey so they won’t have to answer every single time", "-Ked reveals some disturbing finds; one, he found a bullet casing (belonging to none other than Dustin Hoggman). This excites Styx.", "-Dilmah and Ked go their separate ways while the party think about their next plan. They decide it best to travel to the Academy Tower first to gather more information about the nightmares in the city. ", "note: at no point does the party even think to ask Ked or Dilmah what information they have on the nightmares, or if they have heard any rumours, or how they are doing, or maybe if Ked's men have learnt anything new from the Black Bible, maybe any leads onto demonic weaknesses, their opinions on things like fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck GIMME SOMETHING BOYS!!!!", "THE ACADEMY TOWER", "Architecturally speaking, the silver quarter is an absolute dichotomy to the drab walkways and narrow streets of the copper quarter. Instead, you witness the beauty of elven elegance. You recall that Windar was once an ancient home of the Elves of Australis before the first men arrived and banished them from their lands and it definitely shows here. The buildings here, the houses, the shops they are mostly multiple storeys, encased in beautiful, smooth polished granite. The granite stone is light blue and is as if it’s a reflection of the sky itself, a mirror into the lapis lazuli expanse above you. Joining the multiple edifices are looming archways of brick and glass with winding staircases set lavishly against the sandstone road. ", "-Reach the bridge to the Academy Tower within the Silver Quarter. There are four bridges towards the tower, which is made of smooth stone with runic symbols carved into the faces. There is also an eerie blue glow that seeps out from the windows and cracks of the tower facade. ", "-There is also a large crowd here gathering on the bridge. It is a very tense situation as there is a madman here claiming that it is magic’s fault that the demons have come and that the gods have come to punish magicians for their hubris.", "-The first person to attempt to defuse this situation is Saroza, who essentially denounces them all as ungrateful curs. She claims that if it was not for Bickman and the Boys, they wouldn’t even have the luxury to complain. This serves to further incite the crowd.", "-The people seem to also be tense due to the nightmares and blame it on the weird contraption that sits on the top floor in the tower", "-Very tense situation. Finally, Dardy steps in and tells them that it was partly magic that enabled Bickman and the Boys to even kill these demons in the first place. He talked about the good potential of magic and tried to allay their superstitions. ", "-For good measure, Dardy casts an enthrall spell on the entire crowd and gestures for them toreturn to their daily duties. One woman remains behind and further questions Dardy and the party on their intentions, but her worries are put to rest as Dardy insists that their intentions are pure (yeah right, not with this murder-hobo party)", "-Guards are grateful and welcome the party inside. As the doors to the tower open they are enveloped by a strange blue glow, it is like a vacuum and begins sucking them in. As they all jump through, Tim mentions that the tower is actually an entrance into a sort of mini-plane itself. Yeah, thanks for that Tim, bit late.", "A Black Cat", "-When they step inside, it appears to be this huge cavernous structure with multiple winding staircases and tall monolithic structures. There are numerous robed scholars and magicians going about their business, all engaged in some sort of magical endeavour", "-This place seems impossibly large and expansive. From the outside, the tower appears to be a very simple structure but within its walls, this little pocket plane is a wonder of magic. ", "-Anyway, the party find themselves in a lobby overlooking this entire scene. The floor is a very beautiful red carpet and there is a front desk here, a reception of sorts. There is no one here. As Dig calls out for assistance (Styx and Saroza try to yell profanities at the magicians that they see across this chasm), Dardy hears a voice from his left, greeting them with a ", "“You must be Bickman and the Boys. I shall take you to Sabrina”", "-They spin around, expecting a wizened old wizard or maybe an alluring enchantress. Instead, as their eyes wonder downwards they see that they had been greeted by... a black cat? At this point, the party had seen more than their fair share of strange things and so a talking black cat was the least of their concerns. The black cat wasn’t exactly speaking to them physically anyhow. The sounds that would come out of this black cat were normal cat noises but inside their minds they would hear its deep, shrew voice. ", "-The black cat escorts them into this metallic box contraption (it’s an elevator) suspended by strange chains and wires. Dardy says, “Is your name Salem?” This shocks the black cat who is dumbfounded as to how Dardy knows its name but it remains quiet as the magical lift ascends the tower. They discover that Salem the cat is actually the familiar of Sabrina but get no further answers from him even when pressing.", "-Taken to the very top where Sabrina resides; this is about twenty floors. The first five floors are filled with a number of crazy things: (1), a genie trying to be contained by several mages into a lamp, (2) a magical food fight, (3) mages doing target practice with arcane missiles, (4) a class going on teaching the kids how to levitate objects, and (5) a pitch black room with red glowing eyes that is supposedly a trapped god. ", "-The cat leads them to a small office room. There are floating magical books, potions, vials, amulets, all sorts of magical paraphernalia scattered on the messy tables and floors here. Before the party can inquire of the nature of these magical items, Salem disappears. The party have no idea where the familiar has gone. Hopefully to get Sabrina? ", "-There are several notes and journals here written in neat, cursive handwriting; possibly Sabrina’s handiwork. There is also the scent of lilac and gooseberries, which Dardy is particularly fond of. ", "-When Dig walks over to a table and sees a vial of pure blue liquid and investigates, suddenly the ground rumbles and...", "ENCOUNTER WITH WATER ELEMENTALS", "“Enacting security protocols. Eliminating foreign objects.”", "-Before them were two of these amorphous, watery creatures with a large gaping mouth. It seemed to move around the ground by extending its watery form and inching ever closer to the party, who now had their weapons and wits at the ready", "-Prior to this encounter, Saroza fiddled with an amulet that was on the table, which left her right arm paralysed. She attempted to steal the amulet away which ended up paralysing her entire body, save for her left leg. This made her largely ineffectual in the encounter.", "-The party figure out that these water elementals were resistant to nonmagical weapons. Saroza is the first to come up with the idea of using these random magical vials on the elementals. Most of the time Saroza managed to help the party by freezing them or stunning them with the amulet that had previously paralysed her. Other times, she healed the elementals with the other potions found lying around on the tables.", "-One of the water elementals nearly chokes Dardy to death, enveloping him in its cold, liquid embrace. Before he meets a watery end, Dig unleashes his lightning breath and turns the water elemental into steam. The other one is eventually taken care of with enough sword swings from Styx’s boar blade and more potion madness from Saroza’s YEETs", "SABRINA", "-Sabrina appears with Salem next to her. Somehow, they walk up a flight of stairs to this room (the party swore that the stairs were never there and that they would have noticed). She apologises and says she was in the back room. Her familiar is seen with her and it transforms into a black robe which she wears around her. She says that the security measures only usually activate for anomalies or abberations, or primordial beings. Why were they targeted? (it is actually because they have the souls of the Ancient One but the party didn’t pick up on it and so both Sabrina and the characters remain dumbfounded ffs)", "-She says that all of the magical practitioners at the Academy, starting from Initiates, to apprentices, to masters and even herself are experiencing difficulties in magic casting, it has gone wild. Aside from that, there was also the nightmares to contend with. (to reiterate, magic is going wild in the city, and the inhabitants are also being plagued by nightmares)", "-This is when things get weird. She asks them why they were here to see her. The party explained that she had requested them to visit her for more information about the nightmares occurring in the city. Sabrina freezes, saying that she had never met them before.", "-WHAT???", "-Dardy is confused because he had never been in the throne room with the rest of the Boys. The Boys claim that Sabrina was definitely there but this archmage maintained that she had been stuck in this pocket plane for days investigating the source of these magical anomalies. The archmage in the throne room must have been an illusion. ", "-Says that the only leads they have so far come from the Silver Quarter where it seems to be the most recorded incidents", "-Styx tries to do something cheeky, like slapping Sabrina’s ass but the angsty teenage witch clicks her fingers together and he goes flying, slamming against the wall and having all of his wind knocked out of him. To be fair, Sabrina is being quite a smart ass. She seems to have this air of superiority around her and she regards the party as being little more than errand boys (and girl). ", "-This only infuriates Styx more. As they all follow Sabrina downstairs (Dig and Dardy lead the way because they dislike being led), Styx attempts to trip up Sabrina but instead is span around with magic and sent flying down the flight of stairs and colliding with the ground.", "-Everyone sits at the table while cups and flasks are being poured magically; cutlery and utensils are floating about in mid-air while Sabrina is getting something from the oven. Everyone waits as their plates are filled with... boar meat", "-Styx is extremely pissed. Keeping in mind that he essentially looks like a boar at this point in time, he stands up on his seat and swings at the Archmage with his blade. The first strike misses but he corrects it on the second and it makes clean contact with the Archmage. Or so it seems...", "-The black cloak wraps around the edge of the blade and prevents the boar blade from striking Sabrina herself. Then the cloak changes shape into Salem, who is perched on the other side of the table sneering at Styx. Sabrina herself is furious, her eyes filled with extreme anger. Before she is able to incinerate Styx to ashes, Dig casts a sleep spell on Styx, pacifying him. Dig apologises profusely for his companion’s behaviour and promises that it will not happen again. But Dig also cautions the Archmage that should she keep provoking the party with her attitude, even he will be unable to control them", "-Sabrina does one more thing: lead them to see the Vault of Souls", "-They are brought before this ancient elven artefact brought back from the Badlands. It looks exactly like a vault and they can hear these strange groans coming from within. ", "-Apparently it controls the use of magic within the city and is very powerful. Unfortunately, the control rod has been stolen. It’s full potential is unknown. The issue here that Sabrina brings up is that no one without access to the Academy should be able to take the control rod; what’s more, the fact that it went past all of her security measures as well as remain undetected by her wards means that whoever the thief is, they are extremely powerful.

He asks the guards their business and they reveal that the blacksmith (the real one) had been found missing, possibly murdered and they were investigating the site she was last seen. Unfortunately, the guards had apprehended Dardy’s weapons, believing them to be vital clues to the mystery. Fortunately, Dardy didn’t give an ass and took them from the guards promptly.", "-This troubles the party who now have no solid lead to the people behind these nightmares.

A sign at the front reads May’s Mixtures and all manners of aromas permeate out into the street from the ajar door. ", "In front of it, the Boys can see a line composed of both noblemen and the poor from the Copper Quarter extending from the store entrance all the way to a connecting alleyway. A lot of their faces are weary and worn, like they haven’t had slept for days. Considering the current state of affairs, it is highly probable that that is the case. Some of them do take note of your strange group, hardly surprising with individuals like Dig Bickman and his bright blue scales bare for all to see, but they pay little mind as they wait around anxiously to enter. ", "At the present moment, it doesn’t look like you’re getting in.", "-The Boys have some brief interaction with random members of the long line. They learn thatmost of these people have been experiencing similar nightmares, often including some otherwordly blue creature or their loved ones murdering them. They have definitely not been pleasant", "-There is a weak attempt to convince the people to part ways and allow them to cut in line but this generally fails as Saroza is recognised as a murderer in these parts. It turns out that murdering a man in cold blood, no matter how renowned a warrior you are, doesn’t sit well with the locals.", "-The Boys start to formulate a plan about how to get inside. You see, they suspect the herbalist of being directly involved with the culprits of this nightmare business and wish to infiltrate the store (which is full of customers at the moment) and hopefully subdue her for questioning. It doesns’t run through their mind the possibility that the herbalist may be innoccent, or that they could simply waltz in after closing hour without any issue at all. Actually, they probably could have just pushed past everyone into the store. It’s not like anyone would be able to stop them, strong as they are. But the Boys aren’t virgins so they come up with...", "-Using the invisibility cloak that they purchased from Wares Wally.

Tell me, is there something I could help you with?” ", "-There are now only a handful of shoppers aside from the party. Dig takes it upon himself to walk to the front counter and deal with this potential cultist/demon spawn!

There’s a sea of people here and you find yourselves bumping into muscled dock workers, feverish sex workers, slaves and seamen. You welcome the cool ocean breeze as you feel the faintest touch of watery mist against your face. The air here is clean, albeit slightly moist and although the floor is a bit wet, you find gentle respite here among the bustling crowd and constant chatter from fishermen selling their catch. ", "Approaching closer to the water’s edge is where the majority of the ships are docked. The jetty looks sturdy, made of thick strong timber and forming a patchwork of walkways between the larger battleships and smaller trade ships moored here.

The blockade is due to the large number of dead fish appearing on the shores. On the jetty are a large number of fishmen hauling nets of already dead fish that seem to be blackened by some sort of poison. The water is coloured a brown-red and already drawing a large crowd of people who blame it on the demons once again", "-They inspect the jetty closer:", "Your eyes wonder to one ship in particular, anchored down in one of the far corners of the docks. It is not the largest ship by any means and judging from the Jolly Roger on the flag, it is definitely not part of the Imperial Navy. This is a pirate ship, more specifically a galleon. It is this large square-rigged sailing ship with six masts, the keel and frames consist of oak but you can see soft cedar wood for the planking. The ship’s figurehead catches your eye because it is no other than a golden dragon made of a bronze alloy. Whoever this ship belongs to, because currently there are no crewmen on board, must have cost them a fortune.", "-Saroza comments that whoever owns the ship is a fool for leaving such a treasure unguarded and unmanned in a place such as Windar ", "-A kid is happily running along when he bumps into our heroes.

The boy wastes no time in giving him the information and leading them there personally.", "The Salty Sea Dog", " -The tavern itself is filled with many sailors, some pirates and local townsfolk enjoying a drink; it is noisy and lively in here.

She looks a bit like her sister with the green eyes but she has very black hair tied in a bun. She looks to be better off than her sister and older too. L’oreal is initially opposed to meeting the party, mistaking them as representatives from the Academy. Tim assures her that he has the same disdain towards some of the Academy’s practices but also criticises the art of oneiromancy, which almost kills all chances of meeting with L’oreal", "-Tim describes their plight and the importance that they gather more information about the nightmares in the city. L’oreal admits that although it has been good business for her with all the trouble residents going to her for their problems, she should do the right thing and help avert this crisis. She instructs Tim to go to sleep and he does so, triggering some visions ", "-One of the visions is of a house in the silver quarters and a blue tornado rampaging through the tornado. There are screams and people killing each other. Before the vision end she suddenly screams and the rest of you see a green rift in the sky, several cloaked figures and a black dragon ripping its way out of the rift. Then they see a gargantuan stone door with runic symbols on it and its bursting with power on the other end, but in front of it are scores of dead, faces of those you recognise as your friends.", "-L’oreal is troubled by what she saw in Tim’s visions and doesn’t wish to ever see them again. She knows of the house in the vision and directs them towards an abandoned home in the Silver Quarter. She does not ask for coin, only that they leave.

Multiple storied houses here, beautifully trimmed gardens and servants walking around maintain the lawns of the front gardens. If the people of the copper quarter saw this then they would die of jealousy", "-Several people complaining that they haven’t had a decent night’s sleep and others expressing their disdain for the whole thing.

Blood stains on the walls that look brownish, almost as if it is a mixture of both blood and... oil?", "2. A book about suggestion magic stolen from the Academy, contains scribbled notes that explain that a strong enough magical source can induce hallucinations ", "3. Someone inside a wardrobe, banging and screaming. It is Lux who has been gagged and handcuffed, screaming that cultists have infiltrated the city and they are summoning demons. Several other bodies fall out of the closet with her, including the body of the original blacksmith.", "4. It turns out that when Lux entered the city she was split off from Grundle and the rest of the companions, gagged and bound by strange men. She could hear the discussions between the cultists and someone she believed to be a holy man. She also explained seeing a blue figure but couldn’t get a good look ", "-Thankfully, Lux overheard the location of the hideout because the cultists were talking about it in front of her; it was apparently somewhere in the town square of the Bronze Quarter. She expresses multiple times the joy of seeing Tim again but Tim brushes her advances off nonchalantly. Lux goes to meet up with the others and warn her father, the King, about what is going on, while the party resolve themselves to find the hideout.

Lanterns containing fireflies inside hang on strings that connect from rooftop to rooftop so that there is an elaborate network of lamination over the cobblestone ground. Even at night time the city is alive here in the Bronze Quarter. There are several guardson patrol but they appearrelaxed, watching lazily as families stroll past them and minstrels sing in the street corners. ", "The town square looks like the central hub and you spot some carriages drawn by horses making their way past the villagers, bouncing up and down slightly as they go over the bumpy road. In the centre of this town square is a towering marble fountain with a sculpture of a majestic dragon in the middle. This fountain must be at least forty metres in height, towering over even some of the buildings surrounding you. Out of the mouth of this dragon sculpture is not water spurting out either, but rather, wine. Flowing, aromatic, red wine flows freely and splashes into the basin below. It strikes you as a strange sight, for why aren’t there more of the villagers, especially the impoverished ones in the Copper Quarter, coming here for free booze. You realise shortly after the reason for their abstinence in the form of some dead rats floating to the surface of the liquid. ", "Aside from that, you notice a wooden notice board next to a town hall, which appears to be closed at the moment. You also hear on the other side of this town square, a lone man handing out leaflets and shouting words out to the crowd.", "-Dig’s Eye of Melora reacts and his eyes dart around looking for the source. The party are wary and are prepared for some demons or another reality marble. They prepare for the worst.", "-Then, in the corner of their eye approaches a familiar figure: Charles d’Guille. Dig prepares to do some detective work and get to the bottom of this but Charles reveals immediately that he has consorted with the Oni known as Yoshimitsu. He reveals to them the safeword which will allow them to enter the cultist headquarters located underneath the fountain (which turns out to be an illusion of sorts). In return, he begs the party to throw this under the rug and to let him go as it was an honest mistake. The party ‘promise’ to do so and it takes the entire party holding Styx back for Charles to safely exit the scene. ", "-It is strange that someone as cunning and haughty as Charles would so easily give away his allegiances. Was this intentional? Was there another agenda at play here or was he truly afraid of the consequences of betrayal? The party don’t ponder on this too long as they utter the magical safeword and plunge down the fountain of wine.

Tim’s robe flutters about in the wind and ends up getting in his eyes as he falls while Saroza, even with darkvision, flails her arms about trying to grab hold of some loose brick or something to slow the descent. Meanwhile, Styx finds himself laughing maniacally to himself as his cape of berserk allows him to feather-fall graciously down. Is this how it ends?", "Not quite. A glittering blue lake conveniently cushions your fall as you plummet underneath the water’s surface and into its cold depths. How deep is it? Feels like this particular pool is 20 feet to the bottom, surprising that there’s such a water source here below the city… perhaps a remnant of the elven city that Windar was built on top of. Regardless, you hurriedly clamber your way to the top of the surprisingly sparkly water and find yourselves in a dark, cold, cavernous room. Styx then falls on top of Saroza’s head, as he was still floating down from the roof.", "The roof here has a few stalactites, the walls here are cracked, aged, with moss growing between the gaps but you can tell that this place used to be some sort of ancient place of worship. There’s still traces of power which you can feel seeping into your bones. In your immediate vicinity is some shrubbery and you can just make the outlines of some rock structures. When you look up to the hole that you fell down from, there is not even a trickle of sunlight which finds its way here, it must have been scared off.

A group of about maybe five in the darkness ahead of you…", "Entrance ", "-Tim, Dig and Dardy have some trouble finding their bearings here in the pitch blackness of the room. It feels like a damp cave and they’re slightly uncomfortable from wading in this pool in the dark. Styx and Saroza are the first to notice a small concentration of people ahead of them.", "-Tim is faced with realisation and confusion upon hearing the voice of a familiar Academy wizard: Samon. Surrounding this man is a a group of five cultists who are closing in on him with malicious intent.", "-Samon is currently being interrogated by the cultists who are forcing him to give over the rod. Samon insists that he had no idea what he was getting himself into and was no longer comfortable with relinquishing control of the rod to these strangers. One of the cultists knocks Samon to the ground and this is a cue for the Boys to rush into action.", "-There isn’t much left of the cultists by the time the Boys get to them. Tim incinerates most of them with a fireball while the rest of the party finishes them off with might and steel.", "-Samon is extremely relieved to see the party, especially Tim who he has always wanted to be friends with. He explains that he has the control rod and that he was asked by the cultists (who he did not realise were cultists at the time) to give it to them in exchange for exclusive access to their club where they could be friends. Samon, a very desperate and lonely man, took the offer and in the process almost threw away the safety of the whole city. It is because of this that the Boys do not bear too big a grudge on Samon for he was not aware of what he had truly done. Tim sighs and takes possession of the control rod from Samon, thus restoring the stability of magic in Windar and controlling the nightmares within the city. However... there was still the issue of finding the culprits. ", "-Samon requests to tag along initially but the party unanimously rejects him. Samon goes out the same way that the party came in with the help of Tim’s levitation spell. Styx did offer to hookshot Samon upwards but the Boys knew just how reckless and risk-prone that contraption was. Samon, as he is about to leave the underground hideout, declares that he will get Sabrina to come down here and assist. The party are not hopeful that he will get to her in time before they reach the end but they welcome any assistance in this unfamiliar hell.", "2.

Passageway", "-Rubble to the left is blocking the party from passing that way. Dardy inspects the rubble and thinks initially about removing it but realises that this will take much too long. He does, with his incredible perception skills, hear some very low, guttural growls, like the rumbling of an earthquake with every breath, coming from the other side.", "-It looks like the only option is door to the north and door to the east", "5. Skeletons", "-Numerous skeletons here in caskets. One of them is open. It spawns a bone devil.", "-Andruin, with the help of Barnabus, has provided some lore on these particular demons: ", "Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted. At the same time, they long for promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so.", "A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though they are devastating in combat with their claws, bone devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which they use to subdue enemies before striking with their venomous tails.", "6. Hallway of Poisonous Darts", "-The party exit into the room to the left and manage to get the jump on a large number of chaos knights, cultists and even a cult fanatic on the south side of the room. The Boys ready their surprise attacks as Dardy sounds the horn... to critical success. All around them are the uncontrolled ruptures of bowels and pained groans from the abyss as the hellish fiends shit themselves. This sounds the charge of Bickman and the Boys as they get to work slaughtering these foes. More or less the battle goes as planned with Styx, Saroza and Dardy battering away at the weakened enemies while the spellcasters go to town incinerating, electrocuting and shredding them with magic.", "-The party investigate the hallway which has many exits and openings. There are a large number of cultist bodies, ones that they had not been responsible for, littering the floor. Some with no evidence of any noticeable wounds, almost like they had simply fallen dead or something", "-As the party ponder about their next course of action, Dardy decides to take matters into his own hands and goes east right into a hallway of poisonous dart traps. He is hit with one and finds himself in extreme pain, only barely managing to roll out of there. Styx looks at the bard very smugly as he strolls into the corridor and inhales all of the poison into his hardy body. The Boys are initially skeptical that this goblin would be capable of such a feat but after remembering the countless toxic and deadly substances that Styx had consumed throughout their whole quest, they understand that it is pointless to doubt the barbarian’s bravery/stupidity", "7. Summoning Portal Room 1", "-It seems the party have found the summoning portal that most of the demons here in this hideout have appeared from. The summoning portal is surrounded by a circle of blue flames and the party are immediately wary of it as they remember Abbadon being summoned in a similar way all the way back in West Australis where they encountered the dragon egg that would eventually spawn Auron.", "-A baby appears from the portal and is a dilemma: it looks incredibly hurt and covered in blood. Tim and Dig look around the room, which is populated by piles of corpses and bloodstains. Styx, Saroza and Dardy begin formulating a plan to save the baby. Styx is vehemently opposed to it, claiming that this was obviously a trap and that he would play no part in it. But Saroza manages to convince Styx through some fluttering of her eyelids. They resolve to use Styx to hookshot himself through the flames while grabbing the child mid-flight. It is not the smartest plan, as Styx comes to understand, but they go through with it anyway.", "-With the greatest stroke of luck, the goblin just manages to grab the baby by the leg. It is a miracle in itself that the baby’s leg hasn’t snapped as Styx goes through two layers of this burning hellfire circle. As Styx looks into the baby’s eyes, Saroza rummages through her belongings for some bandages or potions that might help the poor baby. However, this is interrupted as the baby suddenly slashes Styx in the face, pushing the goblin back in surprise. The baby takes its true form as an imp and its hideous laughter angers Styx greatly as the rest of the party rush into battle. ", "-The imp’s laughter seems to have attracted the attention of some more enemies; this time, they are lunar demons. The party encountered them previously upon The Dragonfly where they were dealt with relatively easy but the Boys had already been fighting and were already quite exhausted by the previous battles. Fatigue might get the best of them. Four of these lunar demons approach the party from the cover of darkness.", "-This battle can be summarised quite easily; incapacitated. Styx opened up the battle with his hookshot by successfully hooking onto an airborne lunar demon but fails to wrestle the beast into submission, instead losing his grip and plunging into the hellfire. He knocks himself out in the process and finds his skin charred from the blue flames. Saroza and Dardy dispatch one of the lunar devils but on the other side of the room, their companions are still struggling.", "-Tim is very unlucky here. Tim is slashed at by two of these flying demons and is knocked out. Dig would then cast some spells in retaliation and get Tim back up... only for Tim to be knocked back unconscious subsequently. Tim goes through this cycle of revival and unconsciousness about six times; it will be a miracle if he gets out of this encounter without a brain haemorrhage or something. ", "-Saroza on the other hand, is the true MVP of this battle as she unleashes a fury of arrows... onto Styx. You see, she gets blinded by a lunar demon relatively early and in desperation lashes out at all the poor folk in her vicinity. Her arrows and blades do not reach their mark often as she slashes around in true darkness, cutting Styx to ribbons on two occasions, eventually leading to his second knockout. When Styx gets up again to wrestle with a lunar demon, this time succeeding, he is knocked off by Saroza who accidentally misses the demon and strikes the barbarian with her blade cleanly instead. Slowly but surely however... they are succeeding.", "-Dardy senses the futility of the situation and casts his healing spells liberally, curing the party of their most serious wounds while ducking under the talons and beaks of the lunar demon still chasing him. When he is finally free, he channels all of his magicka into a suggestion spell meant to force the demon into submission, ultimately to kill itself of its own volition. But this backfires... tremendously. The lunar demon senses Dardy from a mile away and glares the bard down as the spell fires. The suggestion magic is reversed and Dardy is unable to resist his own spell. He leaps through the hellfire into the summoning circle and he collapses in the centre.", "-The battle is finally won with persistence and desperation but the wounds that Dardy suffered are too great. His last vision before it all faded to black was Tim being knocked down repeatedly as Dig shot spells with one hand and revived with the other, Styx falling onto the ground after failing to wrestle a demon and Saroza repeatedly cutting him in her blind stupor. Then, he breathes his last and dies with regret, unable to sing his story for the world any longer. ", "-In the aftermath of the battle, Styx does the traditional send off (for goblins) for Dardy, wishing him well in Valhalla. Tim and Dig burn Dardy’s body with magic and Styx then collects the ashes in a vial next to another vial of ashes (belonging to his son Sarotyx who he does not remember) on his belt. They also destroy the summoning circle to prevent any more shenanigans. ", "-This is where they hear some more footsteps and they begin to panic. Saroza hears only one set of footprints but she directs the party to be ready in ambush. To their shock, they see Sabrina approach from the cover of darkness. Had she betrayed them?", "-Not at all. It seemed that Samon had succeeded in alerting Sabrina to their plight and she had answered accordingly. But Saroza was not impressed. Their party were on the brink of death and would have been if not for incredible strokes of luck. Sabrina reassured them that she had got there as fast as she could and heals the party to perfect health. Saroza reluctantly accepts her healing magic but is still not impressed with the mage. In fact, Sabrina repeatedly goads Saroza and taunts her, almost as if wanting to elicit a response from the ranger. Time and time again, Saroza takes the obvious bait and is made a fool of by the intellectually superior Sabrina. Saroza grits her teeth and openly plots her murder of this arrogant witch. ", "-Sabrina claimed that she had explored the rooms to the east already and for them not to bother; she had already solved the puzzles there and found a precious artefact; The Guardian. It’s basically a bracelet that attaches to your wrist and morphs into a Captain America shield lol. It’s pretty dope and Saroza is initially interested in it but doesn’t want to give Sabrina the satisfaction so Styx takes it instead. Sabrina reveals some lore about this shield:", "The ranger Dzance found this shield in a chest in the the Lost City of Addadale; its origin is unknown, but it is thought to be of dwarven manufacture. Dzance's Journals tell us of the properties of this item. When he retired from adventuring to live in the Lady’s Court at Dzance gave the Guardian to Belpir, a young knight of that city. The new owner forthwith went adventuring and has not been seen since. The fates of Belpir and of the Guardian are yet a mystery. At least… until now.", "The Guardian is a ", "“+0 shield”, magical in nature but conferring no additional armor class bonus. However, it has a special defensive power: when worn, it radiates an insubstantial magical energy field that envelops you (and only you) like an aura. Any magic missile directed at you from any direction - not just at the shield - will strike this field and be reflected unerringly straight back at the sender with no damage to you.", "This field also grants resistance to all elemental magic damage and can be discharged as a bonus action on your turn to an enemy of your choice (2 charges/day).", "8. Stairway to hell", "-Saroza finds a stairway leading upwards. The party follow her upwards and they find themselves in a room with a basin of holy water. They each drink some and get offered temporary buffs and resistances. Woohoo RPG games! ", "9:Main Hall --> North room ", "-The party find themselves back in the main hall. They go to the North this time and find themselves in a room with another summoning portal identical to the one they had just seen. But this time, crawling out of the hellish flames is a pit fiend holding a colossal tower shield. -", "-Barnabus describes the pit fiend as follows:", "They appear as bestial, scaled humanoids twice the height of any human being with a pair of wings that it can wrap around its body. As venom drips from their fangs, fire wreathes the pit fiend's entire body. When mortals think of devils, the pit fiends are the creatures that are brought to mind. These creatures appear to be large humanoids with brilliant red skin. Their heads are adorned with massive horns while their bodies are cloaked in a pair of bat-like wings. A long, prehensile tail snakes from their backside. The mouth of a pit fiend is filled with sharpened fangs whose bite carries both a terrible poison and a virulent disease. A pit fiend stands over 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds.", "-Once they dispatch it, they travel to the south door and find themselves back in the main hallway again.

This whole room is covered in chains and there’s blood dripping from the ceiling.", "-One of the victims here is, to everyone’s disbelief, is Robin. This doesn’t make any sense because Styx remembers Robin travelling to goblin city atop Pepe to gather goblin reinforcements. Even so, the goblin inches forward to the struggling Robin who is begging to be set free. Styx does not allow himself to fall for an illusion a second time and slashes at the kobold. But when his blade meets with Robin’s flesh, it begins to bleed and Styx fears that he may have slain his lifelong friend...", "-But the DM isn’t that much of a dick and the screaming figure is revealed to be an illusion. ", "-Two chain devils phase into existence and begin assaulting the party. The chain demons look like tortured humanoids that scream incessantly, it’s like they have charred and scarred flesh just cloaked in metal chains that themselves are coated in blood.Scarily, these devils are able to magically control the chains in the room as well as the ones surrounding their flesh to attack and constrain the party. The party remember for the future how dangerous these creatures can be.", "-Upon killing the chain devils, they hear another click and a disturbance in the air.

The Final Boss Room", "The large stone doors groan as they part to the side and your party step through to a cold, spacious hall. Books everywhere, ancient tomes, scrolls all neatly slotted away in rows and rows of shelves on the left and right of you.

You see your breath in the form of a fog as you breathe out, this room is chilling to the bone. But none of that matters to you now because standing in front of you, seemingly unfazed by the unnatural cold here in this hall is none other than a lifelong friend, a companion that sacrificed it all for you, one of the original Boys… Hugh Myrin.", "-Hugh looks a flesh golem, basically like Frankenstein’s monster. His flesh is a patchwork of different colours and skin tones, wounds which he had once sustained were now embalmed and covered up with ointments. He looks like a walking zombie but even more terrifying because he is somewhat sentient. ", "-However, Hugh’s mouth begins to open and sound begins to pour out of it. It is not him speaking but something else speaking through him. ", "“How does it feel to see your old companion being used as a puppet?

So why punish yourselves so?” Hugh raises his arms outwards and unveils the offer of the Oni. ", "“Join me. Join Lucifer. Rid yourselves of this existence and be as gods of Hell. You will want for nothing. You will lack nothing. You will rule all over the denizens of hell for all time. Does that not sound like freedom?”", "“It sounds like madness.” Sabrina casts a magelight spell into the darkness but to no avail.", "Dig looks into the eyes of this imitation of their late companion. He is angered. Frustrated. ", "“Make your deals, demon, Oni, whatever you are. But know that you do so in futility.”", "An unsettling grin spreads across Hugh's face.

What are you-”", "Saroza does not look back. Instead she asks aloud, “Freedom is what you offer?”", "“That is what I said,” The voice returns.", "“You cannot be truly considering this, Saroza.” Dig jokes, but his voice is quivering.

", "“Day after day I experience nothing but contempt from everyone.” She clenches her fists in frustration. ", "“I am not human. The people of Australis have made that especially clear in the way they talk to me, the way they treat me. Yet I am not an orc. The death of my mother makes this even clearer. This world... is not one I belong to. I'm a freak. An abomination. My heart is filled with nothing but hatred for this world.”", "“You're wrong! We- Dig feels Tim's hand on his shoulder.

By the sharpness of steel, by the might of magic. But for Dig Bickman and Tim of Felbourne it is not the physical wounds which hurt, rather, it is the swelling blackness in their heart at having been betrayed by those close to them. For it has been said that it is easier to forgive an enemy than it is a friend. ", "The two of you that remain, Dig and Tim, finally emerge out of that swirling portal and find yourselves in Sabrina’s Academy Tower room. You end up sprawled on the floor in a mess alongside others that came through with you. Only two made it. The Gymnasian treasure hunter Dustin Hoggman and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. ", "As everyone clambers up to their feet, you see Sabrina storm towards you, Dig, and points her finger right in your face. “You! You let this happen! You were supposed to be the leader and now look at this mess!”", "-Dig admits to his folly. He has failed the Boys and blames himself for Styx and Saroza turning to the other side. He wishes that he had done more but it’s too late now. They have lost too many men. ", "She turns her fury to Tim. “And Tim I expected much more of you, having been a student at the Academy. I would have thought out of everyone here YOU would be smart enough to have seen this coming or at least… I don’t know, done something to avoid this… just SOMETHING!”", "-Tim essentially gives Sabrina the middle finger. He claims that while the Boys were off solving everyone’s problem, she did nothing. What’s more, if she really was as powerful as she was supposed to be (being the archmage), she likewise did nothing. This pisses her off big time.", "“Do you know how many I just sent to their deaths? Thirty! Thirty of my finest and brightest. They were my best students and professors. But more than that they were fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. And because YOU two couldn’t choose your companions better, THEY died for it. Hell, you couldn’t even protect your bard.” ", "-Dig finds it particularly distasteful to mention the dead like this but it hits him a bit harder because he had lost TWO bards now. Having seen Hugh in his frankenstein’s monster form brought up some unpleasant memories for the dragonborn.", "Sabrina’s red eyes now glow like rubies and her skin’s complexion begins to change into a shade of pale white like she has been touched by snow. A powerful aura begins to surround her and loose objects in the room begin to levitate. But the thing that catches your attention is her teeth, specifically her canines, which now seem elongated and sharper, more fangs now than anything. This is where her black cloak unwraps itself from her and the familiar known as Salem begins begging her to calm herself.

What we need to do is think our next steps through.”", "“I don’t recall ever seeing you in this city. Who are you and why should we trust you?”", "“For one, I am the man who has deceived both Yoshimitsu and the Gymnasian dictator and is bringing 4000 Gymnasian allies across the sea. Secondly, I helped Robin gather the goblin reinforcements which we now have LOST but you don’t see me losing my cool. Lastly, the Boys and I have met, have we not?”", "-The two of them vaguely recall encountering Dustin Hoggman and are aware that he has Solution Ultima. They have many questions for him, including why he had seemingly betrayed them in Namati, what his relationship with Hugh was, the fate of the goblin reinforcements + Robin + Pegasus and the Gymnasians now supposedly reinforcing them. ", "“I know you will have many questions and I promised they will be answered… at the Landsmeet. But quickly, I need both Dig and Tim to focus. Do you still sense Yoshimitsu’s presence in the city?”", "-They do not sense the presence of Yoshimitsu and Tim prepares for the worst. He suggests that they immediately send a search party to the underground hideout to scout out Yoshimitsu. He doesn’t voice it, but also holds onto the glimmer of hope that Styx and Saroza may still be in the city. Dig agrees with Tim that it is vital for Yoshimitsu to be located at once.", "-However, Dustin seems convinced that Yoshimitsu may have already left the city with the rest of the demons and newfound allies.", "“It is as I suspected. The Gymnasian reinforcements he expected will not be coming and so he has most likely fled. The Oni is no fool. Although I’m sure he didn’t expect to gain two powerful allies in the process. Now, back to the matter at hand. This landsmeet, has it been organised yet?”", "Dig and Tim both shake their head.", "“It seems that this king is a greater fool than I had previously imagined. Well, what is the progress on these quests then?”", "-The party regale their progress to them. They have the control rod which ends the threat of nightmares on the citizens.

Saroza and… Styx, as in Warlord Styx?” Yarrick says nothing in the ensuing silence but his sad eyes speak volumes to the amount of respect that he had towards the goblin.

Nice to meet you, my lady.”", "“I am no lady, I’m just…” Sabrina interrupts. “Why are you here Templarus?”", "-Jomoan enquires about the whereabouts of Charles D’Guille. It seems that the knight has disappeared. The party surmise that the traitorous templarus knight has probably gone off with Yoshimitsu to God knows where. ", "-Jomoan reveals that Yarrick and Musashi joined forces to address the other quest, which was the body doubles or changed people. It turns out that they found that these people, who had the same appearances but were completely different personality-wise, were actually warforged. Since the only person capable of creating such machines in the city is Master Panvon, they were able to incriminate him. However, they cannot find Master Panvon or Unit A.B. They ransacked his workshop and found a potion meant for Tim and an underground laboratory where a lot of the missing people were; all found dead.", "-Yarrick hands the potion to Tim and the wizard decides against using it for now because he isn’t too sure about the intentions of Master Panvon. The wizard cannot completely accept that the halfling was evil, even if he was responsible for the crime. He pockets it and moves on, deciding that a missing foot was better than potential death. ", "-The bad news however is that... Auron is missing. (Again. By now the party is probably sick of the dragon being taken away from them or disappearing. But time and time again they trust strangers to take care of this mythical beast that hasn’t been spotted for ages. Really makes you think doesn’t it?)", "-Btw, the last time they saw Auron, he was the size of a warhorse, his growth seems to be sporadic. The biology of dragons is not too well understood so the DM can get away with this rapid growth.", "-Dustin announces that he will accompany Jomoan and Sabrina to talk to the King about setting up the landsmeet. Sabrina estimates that the landsmeet will take place in five days. Sabrina will contact some of her friends from Sylvania (the party are fairly certain that Sylvania lies to the east but are not too sure about the denizens who live there. Considering that Sabrina herself is a vampire, it is safe to say that she may be bringing in some undead allies- this may cause a stir within the city but there are bigger problems for the time being)", ">Dustin mentions the Gymnasians will arrive in about four days so perfect. Dustin mentions that there is a lot of confusion and just more questions but that all will be answered in the landsmeet, they just need to be patient. Jomoan brings up another point; that in the notes of Master Panvon he mentioned that he required the Philosopher’s Stone from the Springs of Allesia, that it was an infinite power source. ", ">Jomoan wants the party to travel there in the mean time and retrieve it for it would be of great importance to the allies.", ">She offers Yarrick to travel in her stead, as well as four other Templarus knight captains: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The journey should take about four days. It is now early morning, make your preparations now and begin to leave in an hour. There has to be no delay.", "-Sabrina can conjure them another portal but mentions to them that they cannot afford to keep making more mistakes because the dead have to pay for them. ", "-Tim asks to be taken to the bottom floor of the Academy Tower. Sabrina smirks and tells him to use the lift. What a little bitch, Tim probably thinks to himself. Tim hobbles the entire way to the Academy Tower library to garner what knowledge he can for the upcoming ", "Departing Windar", "-Dig visits the Europa dragonborn camp to find it in utter disarray. It seems that with the loss of Admiral Swiftwing and the imprisonment of vice admiral prag, they have lost all hope. Considering their losses to date in this campaign it is hardly surprising that they are losing the mental fight quite severely. Dig tries to brighten up the spirits of the dragonborn but it is clear to him that he must find Taylah, if she still yet lives. Three Dragonborn knights approach Dig, calling him Exile. They are named Fus, Ro and Dah. They ask to accompany them to Allesia Springs because they saw some black scales belonging to Toothless in a stream in the direction of the springs. Dig agrees and the party set forth. ", "-They pay Grundle a little visit too. Grundle is found in the stables alongside Thorin, Dumbo and Sir Nguyen. He is in the middle of procuring a new boar blade for Sir Styx and asks his whereabouts but the Boys don’t know how to answer. They tell Grundle where they are headed and they even manage to convince Thorin to travel with them. Despite their withdrawals about Thorin, at this moment they are in dire need of numbers. And at the very least, the dwarf was mute thanks to Sir Styx (cries in betrayal)", "-They meet up with the Templarus knights. The Templarus Knights and Yarrick are at the front gates waiting for the party, holding camels. They were gifts from Gracy Trimshaw. ", "-Yarrick asks the other knights why they are not wearing plate mail and they will laugh at him, but Yarrick insists that they be in uniform and they ask him if he think he is Saint Allesia or something, he will melt in that steel", "As you and the group of Templarus and Dragonborn knights ride away from the city atop your camels, you have one last look at Windar and its high, towering walls. The Ivory Keep in all its splendour can be seen against the backdrop of hazy, orange sky and although you had only been in the city for a few days, the recent events have left a bitter taste in your mouth. The portcullis lowers with a discordant, jarring sound as you look ahead of you and travel into the arid lands of North Australis.", "The First Day", "Your first few hours of travel are uneventful. Because you are not travelling along the Kronana Freeway, it becomes a bit difficult to navigate based on your surroundings alone because after all, you are surrounded by nothing except the vast expanse of sand. There are a few rock formations, some cacti here and there but nothing overly recognisable. If you had a ranger with you, things would be different but of course we know how that turned out.", "You ration the water appropriately between all of you and eventually you see the sun beginning to set. It is almost night. That’s when you finally come across what looks to be some forgotten ruins on top of an elevated ridge. It looks like whoever occupied it has long since abandoned it because not only are the sandstone walls in complete disrepair, but there seems to be nothing but dead silence in the area ahead.", "-Tim transforms into a falcon to scout the area ahead while Dig nonchalantly makes his way towards the old structure. The dragonborn is probably more occupied with his thoughts about recent events than anything and walks up the slope with disinterest. Tim, while flying overhead, notices nothing peculiar but does notice strange markings on some of the walls. He asks Yarrick about this.", "Yarrick dismounts his camel and looks around. He makes his way to a slight depression in the ground and begins to dig. Then, with excitement he exclaims, “This looks like an old Templarus outpost. Look at these, it’s written in Old Common. I think this might have been used during the times of the first crusades, maybe even by Saint Allesia herself! Can you imagine?” ", "Tim messages the halfling as he continues circling overhead in falcon form. “Not just a Templarus outpost, but perhaps THE Templarus outpost. This may be the very one written about in the tales that signalled the start of the pilgrimage.”", "Yarrick remains in awe. However, to his side, Dig stares with indifference. Seeing his utter disinterest, the Halfling squire frowns. “Surely, you two have heard the story of Saint Allesia right? She was the one who led one of the campaigns against the nonhumans here and founded the Sacred Springs, you know her namesake. Or the story about how she found the Philosopher’s… wait, do you hear that?”", "-They all look to the other side of this elevated ridge and they spot three figures in the distance. They race down to see what’s going on. The rest of the Templarus knights race towards them too. ", "-Argument between the new characters: Prince Gizzard, Ubo and Wah’ter. Prince Gizzard looks to be in some strange garb and makeshift armour, he has a huge tortle shell shield on his back. Ubo looks like Donatello from TMNT with his bo staff and tortle neck sweater lookin’ ass shell. Prince Wah’ter is in some blue deepsteel armour (c) and walks around like he owns the place. ", "-Prince Wah’ter and Ubo say that they are from Lantanis and that they are a triton and tortle, respectively. They describe that they met while fighting alongside each other against the Kraken (this raises the eyebrows of the Boys who are skeptical of this claim). Apparently Ubo is Wah’ter’s bodyguard. Everyone will be shocked because they didn’t think Lantanis was real, it was always a mythical place. Wah’ter seems very zealous as he continually asks the Boys if they’ve heard of Lantanis, or that if they realised that Lantanis was like totally 100x cooler than these terrestrial civilisations. ", "-As for why the lizard man, Gizzard, is there? The party cannot make any sense of the man’s broken common so his purpose for now is indecipherable. Surprisingly, the lizard man can speak some draconic, as evident when Dig greeted him in that tongue.", "-As the party introduce themselves with the newcomers, they are suddenly interrupted by:", "You feel the sands beneath you shifting and you start to lose your footing. The sands swirl and it looks like a thick milkshake of yellow and brown. You look behind you and the old Templarus outpost is now sinking deep underground. It’s dark. You can’t see. Then… a deep resonating bellow erupts from beneath the surface and towering before you is the largest desert giant you have ever seen in existence! In his hand is one of the dragonborn knights. The dragonborn screams, forgetting all sense of pride as he cries for help, then with a sickening crunch, you see his blood rolling down the colossal arm of this creature. Then some screams behind you from heavily armoured creatures join the fold!", "-One of the dragonborn knights, Dah, is the one who gets crunched in his armour. Of course he dies instantly. ", "-The party witness firsthand the acrobatic prowess of Wah’ter’s Dragoon abilities. Dragoons are: “A Dragoon is someone who has been gifted with arcane magic. Instead of using this to become a traditional magic user, the individual uses it to increase their physical prowess. This magical energy fuels their powerful leaps and precise attacks. The Dragoon’s place is not in the heat of battle, but rather it is soaring above in leaps and bounds, usually picking foes one at a time and rocketing down with deadly precision.” In other words, Wah’ter jumps onto the desert giant and begins to cut at arteries and pick at it after perfect aerial maneuvering", "-Ubo turns out to be an elemental warrior and he uses his ice and fire mastery to make short work of the foes. Most of the enemies that he destroys are some gnolls who have gathered to attack the party. The tortle leaves Wah’ter to fight the giant as he has complete trust in his lord’s abilities", "-Gizzard is the king of DOT and metagaming, I mean combat. The lizard appears to be adept at cutting large foes with ease and his lack of fear makes him unstoppable on the battlefield as he fells scores of gnolls around them. ", "-The rest of templarus knights and dragonborn knights, Yarrick and Thorin are helping to fight the other enemies. In the end, only one is left alive: a lamia. ", "“You’ve come for the Springs of Allesia right? You have to be, there’s no other reason to cross this desert. Here’s the deal, my slave trading headquarters, it’s on the way directly there. Let me live, I’ll take you there and we call it even, how does that sound? You won’t find it otherwise, I promise you, this land is non-traversable to outsiders. You won’t be able to tell one grain of sand from another, but we, we, we can! Please!”", "-The lamia explains that she is hired by a slaver group who have a headquarters in the desert. The party ask her if she knows if they had spotted a dragonborn or had knowledge of the philosopher stone. The lamia reveals that they have many dragonborn and wyvern prisoners (probably from after the battle in the skies). She also reveals the general location of the springs and promises that if she is kept alive, she will lead them there. The party accept and also decide to set up camp for the night. ", "-BTW, at the end of the encounter, the camels were spooked and ran off.", "Camping for the Night", "-Setting up camp; the templarus knights and the dragonborn knights have their own tents and their own fires, preferring to keep separate for the time being", "-The prisoner is bound and tied to a post where the party can keep tabs on her. She doesn’t seem to be going anywhere soon. ", "-The party learn more about each other;", "What is it like in the Arafuran swamps? Who are you chasing?", "Gizzard explains that he ate his father, the previous king, to inherit his power and birthright. This is somewhat disgusting to the rest of the party but then again, this guy is a lizardfolk and the Arafuran swamps are something of a mystery to the civilised. It takes the party a while to decipher Gizzard’s broken common and guttural croaks but they eventually understand that he is chasing a lizard wizard. This lizard wizard apparently was consorting with demons to overthrow the lizardfolk tribe... I think? To be honest with you all, I’m not too great with his lore and backstory yet either. There will be opportunities to come to learn! ", "2. Where is Lantanis? It has always been a myth, why are they surfacing now? What is Lantanis like?", "Lantanis is located in the Lantanic Ocean, as the name suggests. The two explain that they have a thriving underwater civilisation far more advanced than anything seen here on the land. They practically froth at the mouth (and probably gills) at telling the party about their home. The reason for them surfacing now is of course due to their supposed encounter with the kraken (unverified) and the increase in corrupted seafolk and so forth of late", "3. How did Ubo and Wah’ter meet?", "Ubo is trained as an elemental warrior and found himself back to back with Lord Wah’ter during an attack by some corrupted seamen (hehe). Ever since, he has become the lord’s personal bodyguard, as well as a friend", "4. What’s the story behind your weapon, Gizzard?", "It was once again hard to get an intelligible response from Gizzard but apparently it was taken from the tooth of a giant T-Rex? Basically a big bad mofo which the barbarian dismembered, beheaded, probably all sorts of depravity and then used it as a hammer, or was it a spear? *gizzard grunt intensifies*", "-Food supply is running low and the camels are gone, need to ration water. Will take two days to reach the slaver HQ without camels ", "-Yarrick will continue to train at night, inspired still by Styx’s words to this day", "-Party travels for another day, a full day and another rest. It takes them slightly longer because they do not have their camels anymore. Not to worry, they still make good progress and good speed. ", "THIRD DAY", "-On the third day… they find themselves at the base of the Slavers", "-They meet with the guard posted out the front, who is a gnoll. There are obviously a lot of gnolls here and all despicable slavers. There is a brief moment of diplomacy before Tim and Dig decide that they just need to blow off some steam. Yarrick is horrified as he watches Tim and Dig walk through the camp shocking, incinerating, freezing and vapourising gnolls without any mercy. All of their anger basically channeled into their spells as they mutilate the shit out of the slavers. There are no survivors, save the lamia prisoner that they decided to let free. ", "-They free forty riders and their wyverns, there are also about 200 men, women and children who they choose to save. They send the two remaining dragonborn knights and two of the four templarus knights (Luke and John) to escort the people back to Windar while the rest of them continue forward.", "-But no sign of Taylah. The dragonborn can say that she was seen falling further south. Yarrick says that’s the direction of the Springs.", "-As they travel forward, a sandstorm begins to brew and how it forces party backwards but there is no shelter; only way is to move forward ", "-Encounter 1: Styx and Saroza illusion (Thorin falls for it, as does Gizzard)", "-Encounter 2: Sandstorm which separates the party from the rest of the companions so they are low on water. They can see the sparkling of an oasis or water in the distance (Dig, Tim, the two Templarus knights, Ubo succumb to their thirst) ", "-Encounter 3: You see a beautiful woman dancing across the sand. She’s singing to herself and motions for the party to come dance with her. As soon as she’s touched she collapses into sand and a slight giggle is heard on the wind. Only Yarrick and Lord Wah’ter have made it this far but Yarrick loses to his heart and follows the singing maiden. Lord Wah’ter is now all alone...", "Springs of Allesia ", "-The oasis is beautiful; nymphs everywhere singing songs, palm trees, magical healing waters, they sing to the party and carrass them. The party members who were lost are seen here enjoying wine and playing with sirens", "-Yarrick recognises one of the nymphs as Saint Allesia and is able to voice this out to a confused Lord Wah’ter who has almost zero knowledge of the surface world. He engages in dialogue with Saint Allesia, this beautiful woman with a sonorous voice. She welcomes him to her Springs and asks what his business is. He explains his desire to obtain the philosopher’s stone to which she directs him to the oasis. There is a sword in stone in the middle of the lake. Lord Wah’ter goes to pry it out when suddenly...", "-Allesia is revealed to be a Rusalka and this creature brings up the water level so that the whole party is now completely submerged. This snaps the rest of the party out of their trance and they realise they are slowly being drowned. The combat encounter involves some sahuagin which although are fragile, prove a nuisance to the party as the real foe, Allesia, tangles each of the party members in her hair and strangles them (Sahuagin are like basically corrupted fish people, they’re pretty disgusting)", "-Tim fight valiantly with his human limitations, the primary one being that he cannot breathe underwater lol. His lack of two feet is also making it hard for him to swim efficiently under water so he is eventually breathless and beginning to drown to death. Thankfully, Ubo manages to take Tim in his arms and swim into an underwater cavern that he miraculously discovers due to feeling a draft in the air. He gets sucked in and finds himself in a dank cave with a magical barrier keeping the water out. How did this get here?", "-Dig has an excellent idea to polymorph both himself and Yarrick into sharks. This is an incredibly genius move because it allows them to breathe and move effortlessly in the terrain. However, unbeknownst to them, the sahuagin have a special ability to telepathically control sharks. It’s safe to say that Dig and Yarrick have a blast biting and charging their allies", "-The rest of the party eventually manage to kill Allesia, not with some difficulty as she keeps disappearing and reappearing in the water.", "-The water suddenly begins to swirl and form a littlel whirlpool as it all drains into the cave. The entire party is sucked into the cave, narrowly missing collisions with jagged rocks as they enter the magically fortified shelter. Inside they see not only Ubo and Tim, but a very familiar dragonborn admiral and her black wyvern, unconscious", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

There was also no sign of Master Panvon or Unit A.B. ", "-Apparently the people of Windar were shocked at having witnessed the coming of the 300 Lantanis soldiers provided by Lord Wah’ter but received them relatively well. It seemed that compared to the greenskins, the humans and halflings of Windar didn’t harbour any preconceived notions towards the triton army. Outside the walls the party also spotted a force of about 4000 strong Gymnasian troops, comprised of beastmen and animal-kin and whatnot. There was also rumours of a small dwarf contingency having arrived in the city but the party were yet to encounter them.", "-Overall, the city was abuzz with excitement for the landsmeet and the increasing number of exotic peoples now gathering outside the city walls. Initial distrust and xenophobia were now beginning to fade away to be replaced by a promise. The promise that these demons would be pushed back and that the people could triumph. ", "-The fact that the nightmares and body double incidents were now taken care of also played a large role in the people’s new opinion of the Boys. The party are now hailed as true heroes (as if they were ever anything besides). How long this will last? Nobody knows. The whims of the crowd are flimsy at best. But for now the party should rejoice that they have the support of the people and more importantly, its armies.", "-I should mention that there is also less hatred of the Academy now and more people are turning to the gods- especially Akatosh and Celeste. The problem, made more prominent by recent events, is squalor. There is only a finite amount of space inside the mighty walls and outside there is only so much resources to go around. Perhaps it won’t be the demons that will be responsible for mass casualties but rather man against man...", "-On arrival into the city, Jomoan was found waiting in front of the city gates. She promptly notified you that the landsmeet will be happening tomorrow night (keeping in mind that the Boys arrived in the city in the very early hours of the morning) ", "The Gold Quarter Hospital", "You’re currently sitting alongside your companions in the Gold Quarter hospital, the very same hospital that Dig and Tim were nursed back to health when they crash landed in Windar. The air here is stale and cold as it is still the early hours of the day and the sun has yet to shine on the city. Your journey back from the Springs of Allesia was uneventful and made easier as you were miraculously reunited with your camels. ", "However, what you uncovered in the Springs was more than mundane. Lying on the two beds in front of you all right now is Admiral Taylah Swiftwing and Toothless. Your party rushed these two to the hospital as soon as you arrived in the city and have been sitting here for hours waiting for Taylah to stir. The admiral’s chest has been rising slowly up and down so she is at the very least, alive. ", "-The party debate with each other on their next move. Their primary concern was that the landsmeet was soon to begin and that they would need the Admiral and her support. Yet in her current state, she could help no one. Thankfully...", "You hear the bed sheets rustle as Taylah finally comes to in a dazed jolt. Her eyes are barely open and her voice is shaky, she is evidently weakened. “Where am I? Where is Toothlessss, is he okay?”", "The party gesture to the slumped body of the black royal wyvern. Its hulking figure is much too large for the bed. It is a miracle that the bed frame hasn’t collapsed.“You have my undying gratitude, Dig and Tim. But where are your other companions? Who are these that stand with you now?” ", "After Dig and Tim explain the situation with the greenskin turncoats, Lord Wah’ter and Ubo introduce themselves. Then they introduce Lantanis, of course.", "Prince Gizzard does the same. He tries his luck and questions her on a lizard wizard, to which she has no insight to offer.", "“Well met. It seems that this demonic conflict affects even those we thought of as myth.” She pauses, and you see hatred burning in her eyes as she recalls. “It ssseems we are having an abundance of traitors lately. Where is that fool, Prag? He has dragonborn blood to answer for.”", "Dig reassures her that Prag will be dealt with accordingly. But for the time being, he is still chained within the Ivory Keep’s dungeons.", "“And the ssssship? How are my men?”", "Dig laments that the draconian force’s morale is at an all time low and that without the leadership of Taylah, they are slowly starting to crumble into ruin. This startles Taylah, probably a shock to her since she doesn’t realise her importance to the fleet.", "You hear Taylah mutter several words in draconic. Dig and Gizzard understand that she is swearing quite profusely. The admiral looks up and says. “One good thing did come out of this, however.” ", "She gingerly reaches out into her pocket and produces something so beautiful, so pure that you cannot help but stare. It is a gem without flaw, no nicks or scratches, discolouration or blemishes, and its colour cycles constantly from that of a ruby into a sapphire, then an emerald, then garnet, then diamond. She holds this gem up to her face and as you look through its lustrous surface, you see inside what looks like an aurora. You feel yourself caught in this maelstrom of vivid colours and radiant beauty. Without a doubt in your mind, you know that this is the Philosopher’s Stone, and you know that it is perfect.", "-The party is speechless. They cannot find the words to describe their beauty but there is definitely something terribly alluring about it...", "-Nobody voices their desire to obtain this stone for themselves but something stirs in each of their hearts. This artefact, this thing, was incredibly desirable and it whispered sweet promises to each of them. Or did it? Could it have just been the weakness of their own temptations, their own failure of spirit?", "-Tim is worried. He tries to pierce through his cloudy eyes of adoration to understand the potential problem this powerful artefact might have. He asks Taylah how she came to acquire it.", "Taylah smiles as she notices the admiration on your faces, especially a brute such as Gizzard. “The famed Philosopher Stone. I don’t even know what it does. But it’s beautiful. When I realised I had landed in the desert, I wanted to find out if the rumours were true. I had not bargained in meeting with your Saint Allesia and then being turned into fish food, however.” ", "-Tim asks her to give the stone to him. Whatever power or abilities this thing possesses, the wizard wanted to make sure that it would be under the possession of the Boys alone to avoid any drama between the factions. Unbeknowngst to the wizard, the rest of his companions, especially Dig, eyed the stone with lust. Reluctantly, Taylah handed over the Philosopher’s Stone to Tim, who pocketed it safely within his belt.", "Her eyes narrow. “Is the landsmeet still proceeding?”", "Dig nods.", "“Very good. Now, Dig Bickman, put out your hand.”", "Dig is wary at first but begins to reach his hand out, palm upwards, confused.", "“Dig Bickman, let it be known that you are a friend to the Dragonborn. Whatever crime or circumstance led to your exile I do not know, but with the power vested in me, I hereby declare you as kin once again.” She smiles.", "-The party can see Dig trying to hold back some tears. Dig himself tried desperately to not give in to emotion because he felt that he had to stay strong for the Boys and maintain his image as the cool, composed leader of the group. Deep down in his heart though he knew he was finally one again with his people. A certain sense of contentment filled him. He thanked Taylah, as a gentleman does, and felt renewed.", "“Now, if you’ll excuse me. I need some rest. I will be there at the landsmeet, don’t you worry. I’ve come too far to quit now. Could you do me a favour and let the men know that their admiral has returned?”", "Dig accepts. He has no reason to do otherwise. ", "She thanks you and she returns to her slumber. ", "-The party go off on their separate ways to indulge in the city’s pleasures or complete some tasks of their own before the landsmeet tomorrow evening.", "Free Roam in Windar ", "-Ubo spends his time in Windar by first traversing the streets. He finds himself drawn to the copper quarter and is astounded by the poverty and decay here. Back in Atlantis, he thought, everybody was treated equally and even the common folk could ascend to greatness. Here, not so much. Out of the goodness of his heart, the tortle sets up his signature cooking apparatus and gets to work, creating works unseen to the surface folk. The people thank Ubo profusely while downing his famous (Tortle?) soup. Suddenly, Ubo is stopped by a courier who is carrying a piece of parchment with a royal seal on it.", "-Lord Wah’ter decides that Windar does not fully comprehend the beauty that is his homeland, Lantanis. He sets off, all the way from the copper quarter to the silver quarter, boasting of Lantanis’ superior... well superior everything. It is only when he walks past two Templarus knights that he almost gets himself killed. The Templarus Order are a religious sort, clearly. One with any semblance of social etiquette would refrain from broaching the matter, but the triton prince cannot stop himself from denouncing the Templarus gods and instead proclaiming the aquan gods as their betters. As the Templarus knights ready to unsheathe their steel, Tim arrives in the nick of time to defuse the situation. Thank god for diplomatic immunity or we would have a triton head on a spike. Tim escorts Lord Wah’ter reluctantly through the city while enduring his self righteous speeches of beautiful Lantanis. The triton notices that the wizard is excited about something but doesn’t ask. Suddenly, Wah’ter is stopped by a courier who is carrying a piece of parchment with a royal seal on it.", "-Prince Gizzard explores the sewers looking for food and mostly because he just enjoys the dank and disgusting atmosphere. After all that is said and done, he does come from a swamp. In his short foray into the sewers he comes across a sewer frog fluent in ebonics. He convinces the frog of his magnificence and to inform the rest of the Aruarian swamp peoples of their lord’s fate. The lizardman strolls peacefully in the sewers for a while longer before sniffing out some pleasant aroma from a sewer grate directly above. He leaps out, immediately startling the people in the Copper Quarter and sending others into nausea from his smell. He spies a familiar tortle elemental warrior cooking up a storm and rushes to Ubo’s stall. Gizzard is surprised at Ubo’s culinary prowess and begins to feel some guilt at having fantasised about eating the tortle himself, but not that much guilt. Suddenly, Gizzard is stopped by a courier who is carrying a piece of parchment with a royal seal on it.", "-Tim hobbles to his room at the Academy where he sits on his bed, contemplating the secrets of life and the fabrics of reality. He steels himself for what he is about to do, for the feat that he is about to attempt. He was going to try to create a pocket plane. He now had the power to do so as he was in possession of the famed philosopher’s stone. The power courses through his veins and the aether itself calls out to him with tempting whispers. Barnabus assists Tim as he focuses his powers and concentrates, trying to pierce the reality he is in. Tim feels fear creeping up his spine which threatens to overcome him, but he lets the power of the philosopher’s stone take hold, letting his magic flow freely and then... he did it. He finds himself in blackness, a void. There are no constructs here, no objects of interest, no life. Absolutely nothing. The wizard grins to himself. He has done it. ", "The wizard eventually reaches up with Lord Wah’ter when suddenly, a courier appears, carrying a piece of parchment with a royal seal on it.", "-Dig goes to inform the dragonborn of the good news: the Admiral is alive! None of the draconian forces pay him much heed. To them, the sting of their recent losses was still too fresh in their hearts. The sorcerer tries in vain to get their attention but is helped when Fus and Ro, the two dragonborn knights who joined the party in their quest for the stone, vouch for Dig’s honour and valour. Dig goes on to proclaim not only the safety of Taylah and the promise of returning to their former glory, but announces that he is no longer an exile. This would probably be one of the most important moments of his life. Upon his return to the city (as the dragonborn camp is outside Windar’s walls), he is suddenly stopped by a courier who is carrying a piece of parchment with a royal seal on it.", "-Each of them come across this message:", "Bickman and the Boys are requested for an audience with the King immediately. Failure to comply will result in appropriate punishments.", "Audience with the King ", "It has been a while since you’ve walked in the royal courtyards in all of its extravagance. Thankfully there aren’t many nobles because it’s still early in the day so you don’t have to deal with their smug looks and wry remarks. You make your way down the looming archways and are escorted by two Templarus knights through the dark wood doors into the ivory keep. ", "There sits King Dawnchaser with Jomoan and Sabrina by his side. At his feet are two small boys of barely seven years, hair a mess, wearing rags. They look up in unison at you with tearful eyes as the king continues to caress the napes of their necks. Sabrina and Jomoan look away, ashamed but silent in their role. ", "Sabrina messages you all, telling you to bow.Everyone refuses to bow. Tim and Dig because they cannot tolerate this degenerate. The others because they do not recognise this man as a king. ", "The king largely ignores the disrespectful gesture. He is too occupied with his playthings. “Welcome to my halls once more, Bickman and the Boys. Or if I hear correctly from my advisors, Bickman and the Boy. My heart… aches terribly for your loss.” There is an obvious lack of sincerity in his voice. He continues to stroke the children with his hands as he slumps back in his throne. “Ah but true to form, the mercenary group invites more to its ranks. Who, pray tell, are these creatures?”", "-Dig introduces the newcomers. They behave well enough but there is always the risk that Gizzard may decide to forget his surroundings and do something obscene like taking a dump on the floor. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo forget themselves and ask the king if he has heard of Lantanis to which the king replies affirmatively, he had indeed heard of Talantalantis/Talantis/Latanis/LantanitalaneiYEET", "“You are welcome in this city as long as you abide by the law for only the gods are above the law.”", "You see Jomoan roll her eyes as he says that.", "He then says, “I hear you’ve done my city a great service. Such loyal men to the kingdom deserve a just reward. Speak, anything that is in my power I will grant to you.”", "-Tim and Dig discuss this amongst the two of them for a very long time. They go between monetary rewards to titles to everything in between. Eventually they settle for a favour; that the king will take their side when the time comes on a certain matter (is this ever used later on? I’m pretty sure they forget about it)", "“Then it will be done. You will find that I am a generous king. Now, this landsmeet that you so desperately wished for will be going ahead tomorrow evening. I command you to dress appropriately for the occasion. Find yourself some decent attire and meet out the front of the city gates tomorrow at dusk. Is this clear?”", "The party doesn’t dignify the king with a response.", "“That will be all.” The King stands up and puts one hand on the shoulders of each of the boys, leading them like a shepherd would his flock as he leaves you. Jomoan and Sabrina wait a moment before also standing up and following King Dawnchaser closely behind. They give you a short nod before heading off. Two Templarus knights then escort you out of the throne room and you stand in the courtyard once more.", "Getting new clothes", "-The party is in the courtyard. Tim figures that it is time to try out the potion that Panvon gave him because all in all, he has grown very tired of limping everywhere for the past year. That being said, he still doesn’t fully know Panvon’s character and his intentions. This potion could just as well be a poison that makes him lose his other foot and then what do we do? We can’t retcon that as well!", "-Ubo starts to cook up a special stew that will increase Tim’s resilience to poison. At the very least, if Tim dies, he will have a good final supper. Tim volunteers to go find some appropriate clothing for the rest of the party. Lord Wah’ter politely declines, saying that he has his own formal dress back at the Triton warcamp. Dig and Gizzard relax in the courtyard. ", "-Tim decides that the Academy will have some appropriate robes for the occassion. He travels to the floor that he used to get his uniform from and is pleasantly surprised to find Maybelline there. She has just finished with a client and appears to be managing the store. The uniform store has been renovated and turned into a fancy dress store- fancy that!? Anyway, Tim informs Maybelline of Dardy’s demise and expects her to bawl her eyes out but she seems to accept the news quite easily (cries in Aidan). Tim and Maybelline engage in some wholesome dialogue as she gets Tim’s measurements and provides him with a very stylish red cloak. Ubo gets a nice silvery-grey robe and Dig is given a beautiful green-blue robe that matches his scale colours. Before Tim leaves he sees Andruin also coming in to get some clothes and gives him some books that he was carrying for the old elf since chapter 3, I mean the Udakak forest. They also engage in some discussion about the rifts. Tim recognises that it is paramount that the party get to the badlands soon to investigate this rift (Doran left for this rift at the end of chapter 3 too but there has still been no response)", "-Tim returns to the rest of the party where he hands them their new garments. He first drinks the soup. Mmm, tasty. Then he drinks the potion. He is sent into a coughing fit and the rest of the party can only stare in horror as the wizard reels over in pain and starts retching all over the place. Then, they see the stump on his right/left (forgot which foot) leg begin to glow like hot metal and after a few minutes, there is now a new foot. It looks a bright red and clearly different to the rest of his complexion but Tim doesn’t care; he can put a boot over it. He now had two working feet again.", "-The party each go their separate ways to rest for the night. Ubo and Wah’ter depart for the triton camp where they are welcomed with open arms. Gizzard sleeps somewhere on the streets with his tortle shell shield as a cover from the elements. Dig pays Taylah a quick visit before retreating to the dragonborn camp and finally Tim, returns to the Academy.", "The Colonnade", "-The next evening...", "As the sun begins to set, your party head towards the city gates of Windar. You walk between the pathways of the bronze and silver quarter and above you spy the skeleton of a dragon from ages past that stretches as far as the eye can see from the front gates all the way to the coliseum outside of the Ivory Keep. It forms this eerie bridge of sorts between the keep and the city’s high walls. Even in death this majestic creature seems to have a purpose. For Dig and Tim, this makes them long for Auron even more, where had the golden dragon gone?", "You notice while meandering to the meet up point that there is an increased number of people out on the streets, many of these people holding up signs, some bouquets of flowers and others with baskets containing what looks like confetti. Before long, rows of people start to line up to your left and right, forming this sort of walkway like a procession of sorts. From the looks in their faces you realise that they are here for the landsmeet, some maybe even for you.", "You are now at the front gates and you can barely believe your eyes as you recognise most of the people gathered here alongside you. They are all dressed in fine clothes and mounted on some finer horses. From the Namati desert are Ala’din and Gracy Trimshaw. From the hobgoblins are Sakura and Musashi. The orcs have the old shaman, Yurtruz, to represent them it seems. There’s also Old Man Fenrir from Grelivia, the Jarl of West Australis, Arthalas and Andruin are here from the Banksia World Tree. To your surprise, even Admiral Swiftwing is here, but she is held up by two dragonborn knights, Fus and Ro. She masks her obvious discomfort with a smile as you approach.", "Then there are others that you don’t know so well or even met before. The first of them you briefly encountered, the vampire counts. Their faces are still shrouded under the hoods of their black gossamer silk robes and when they walk it is like they’re floating above the ground with this ethereal grace. The next of these newcomers are easily distinguishable from the rest of the mortal races by their generous, unkempt beards and short stature. Some dwarves from Urulu. Strange, you heard that they had refused the call and you don’t know dwarves to go back on their word. Perhaps these are some outcasts of some sort. In any case, their presence is welcome. ", "-Tim wonders who these floating figures are. He cannot for the life of him figure out what they area so he thinks. And thinks. And thinks. He’s got it. They are floating black slimes sent to kill them. FUCK! He warns his leader, Dig, of the terrible news. Initially Dig is also skeptical but upon closer inspection comes to the very same conclusion. Black slimes have infiltrated the landsmeet...", "-Party proceed down the colonnade via horses provided by Templarus knights", "-Crowd cheers for them", "-One of them asks Dig to sign her breasts. He refuses to do so. ", "-Most of them stare in wonder at the tortle, the triton and the lizardfolk. Ubo and Wah’ter waste no time in celebrating the glory of Lantanis while Gizzard generally remains indifferent, just another gathering of softskins. ", "-The party all in all feel pumped, ready to get started with this landsmeet.", "You dismount your horses when you reach the Ivory Keep’s front doors and follow behind the rest of the dignitaries into the throne room. Templarus Knights numbering in the dozens escort the entire group of you into an adjacent room. You hear the creak of the doors slowly closing and eventually when the doors slam shut with a sudden THUD, you cease to hear the glorious cheers of the crowd outside. ", "And now, let the landsmeet begin.", "THE LANDSMEET", "The Reception", "You find yourselves in a lavishly decorated banquet hall that oozes with the exorbitance of the golden quarter. A dangling multi-tiered chandelier, portraits plastered on the walls of past kings and queens, carpet so raspberry red you can smell it. ", "The light of the silvery moon shines clearly through the two giant polished windows that overlook the city and refracts into vivid colours as it dances around the candlelit hall. Dozens of servants carry platters above their heads of food and wine to the table, where fine golden plates and silverware have been meticulously set out on this table stretching from one side of the room to the other. ", "Before long, you spot Sabrina and Jomoan appear from the front of this hall, each dressed in fancy garments. Jomoan looks a little funny because the length of the skirt is a bit too long so it drags behind her as she walks. The Templarus Knight Commander announces to all of you. “The landsmeet shall begin very shortly. King Dawnchaser, blessed be his name, invites you to enjoy some refreshments and to mingle while you wait. Thank you.”", "-It was awesome to see all the allies that the Boys had made now gathered here in this one spot. Everyone they encountered, every person they saved, helped etc now here because of them. Hype af", "Party mingles with the guests", "-Party mingles with the guests. The party go around and catch up with some companions they gathered along the way. Lord Wah’ter is in a sort of kimono garb that looks like it’s made of some expensive seasilk while the rest of the party are in their opulent robes. This is quite a fancy event, a lot of ceremony and pomp. When will they get to the important things, like you know, the demon invasion threatening to end all of existence", "-All of their allies are here (save for the Witchfielders because I forgot about them lol don’t worry will mention them next sesh), as well as some accompanying bodyguards, soldiers and so forth just for security sake. There is certainly a high level of trust here, since no weapons were confiscated at all. Was this overlooked by the DM or negligence? I’ll let you be the judge.", "-Sultan Ala’din congratulates the party. All of this is possible because of the party’s actions. He promises his support in the landsmeet. He meets the new party members with open arms. Dig is quite happy to see Ala’din here, probably one of the allies that he has more of a liking towards.", "-Sultana Gracy Trimshaw thanks Tim on the political decision of joining Galkoorlie and Tyr. She mentions sthat Ala’din is a handful but the nation is made stronger by it.", "-General Dilmah remarks on the last time they had a drink together with Tim and how he detests banquets and politics. He is particularly interested by Lord Wah’ter and his military tactics but chooses not to get too in depth at this stage. There will be time for this later. He has a good long chat with Tim about how things have been and the good old days while Dig also joins in to catch up with the former Arcabern general. Dig isn’t too surprised to hear that the dwarves refused to commit their forces due to hatred for the humans milennia past. Apparently the dwarves have a book of grudges called the K’ammaz Dron’ which they keep a list of all the people that have wronged them since antiquity (the dwarven exile faction will go more in depth probably at a later stage in the campaign, but keep this in mind for now) ", "-Musashi is angry at the greenskin traitors and pledges to bring them to justice; especially Saroza who has his ancestral sword. He drinking a cask of sake, says the wine here is like water. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo taste the drink, savouring it. However, Gizzard produces his own specialty beverage; swamp wine. I suspect that no one really knows what is in swamp wine, not even Gizzard himself. Musashi pretends to drink the concoction, sneakily spilling it on the floor behind him. Gizzard miraculously does not realise and continues to down the foul liquid. ", "-Sakura doesn’t say much but asks what they will do when they find Styx. She says very little and seems to be in an extremely foul mood. Lord Wah’ter finds himself strangely attracted to the girl and attempts to flirt but is immediately hit with the IGNORE", "-Yurtruz the Shaman is approached by the newest party members. The three of them are dumbfounded at this strange creature. They have never seen an orc before and to the aquans this shaman looks like some green human. Lord Wah’ter wonders whether she is ill or has some weird skin condition. Ubo wonders whether he can help the poor creature with one of his curative meals. Gizzard wonders if Yurtruz tastes good. Yurtruz’s eyes meet with Tim’s for the briefest of moments and although Tim doesn’t particularly want to talk to her, it would have been too awkward to ignore so he comes to greet the shaman. She asks Tim about how his powers have served him and upon hearing positive feedback, offers to teach him more later down the road. Tim heartily accepts. ", "-Old Man Fenrir is a strange sight. The party is used to seeing him in his alpha werewolf form so when they see the old man at the landsmeet they are initially taken aback. He greets the party, looking at the silverware around him and smirking.", "-The Jarl Colan Barnette is not especially pleasured to see the party. Attempts to speak to the man is met with a look in the other direction. There is an obvious dislike towards the elves that have gathered here too, evident with his derisive laughs and snark remarks to his guards. ", "-Arthalas regrets that his wife couldn’t make it. He hates the human city, it is so unnatural and crowded and it smells of wet dog everywhere he goes. He seems a little out of place here at the banquet and although he still maintains his elfish grace, you can see that he is impatient to see this thing through. ", "-Andruin remarks that they must absolutely try the strawberry tarts. He is writing in a book. It turns out that Andruin is keeping a record of everything occurring here in the landsmeet. Someone has to, he reasons. He wishes that he had a talking book like Tim.", "-The dwarven exiles from Urulu are greeted by Wah’ter, Ubo and Gizzard. The dwarf smacks the bottom of a passing serving lady, which certainly doesn’t do him any favours. He spots the three of them approaching and:", "One of these dwarves sees you. He’s clean shaven with bright orange hair tied in a bun. You stare at each other for a long instant before he reaches up to his pick his nose. Then, he regards you for a moment before extending his hand, the very same one. ", "“Ello there lads. What are ya standin’ around gawkin’ fer? It’s like ya never seen a beardless dwarf in yer life?”", "Lord Wah’ter, Ubo and Gizzard admit that they haven’t. In fact, Lord Wah’ter is completely convinced that this dwarf is a small child of the humans and picks him up. Surprisingly, the dwarf allows the triton to do so. Satisfied, Lord Wah’ter puts the dwarf back down and makes a mental note that human children are quite heavy.", "The dwarf smacks the bottom of a passing maid as he takes a sausage roll from the platter. “Ahahaha. Aye, aye, nice to meet ya and all. Name’s Varrus! I’m the leader of the Urulu Outriders.” ", "This doesn’t seem to mean anything to the trio. He could have been the latrine officer for all that it mattered. ", "“King Hrothgar, the stupid fool, refused to come to the landsmeet or commit his forces cos of the grudge against humans for taking Allesia from us all those years back. So many years even the greybeards would’ve lost count I reckon. Fair call I’d say but those bearded fools in the tribunal don’t realise the threat of demons like we do. Like the outriders do. Aye, we’re the ones who ride out deep ‘neath the caverns and fight all manners of hellish beasts. So I took my men and left to come here first I chance I got. But… it’s safe to say we’re probably banished from the realms ahahha! To hell with it, if you’ll excuse the pun hahaaha!” He raises a mug to you.", "The three of them do the same and take in a generous swig of the house wine.", "“Now if we’re done gossipin’, Imma start gallivanting towards that pretty lass over there. Speak more soon, I hope!” ", "-The vampire counts from Sylvania aren’t a very particularly talkative bunch. Dig and Tim watch from the distance in horror as they watch these black slimes take on humanoid forms. It takes all of their willpower to suppress their screams and run off into the night. The more sensible party members- didn’t think I’d ever have to say that- investigate these creatures more. They seem to be mysterious vampires known as the von Rammsteins. They sport elongated canines, extravagant black robes, well kept hair and all that- just picture the classic vampire stereotypes and mix a little castlevania flair and you’ll get the general picture. Their names are Alucard, Alaric, Vlad and Prosperine. Vlad seems to be the oldest of these creatures, even though admittedly they all look no more than their late twenties or early thirties. He speaks for them. Prosperine takes a particular liking towards the tall and mighty triton and begins to caress his neck, sniffing him out, savouring him either as a snack or plaything. Lord Wah’ter doesn’t really understand what is going on and simply allows this to happen. Ubo is unsure of whether this woman is a threat to his lord or some sort of succubus but is ready in an instant to defend his lord if need be. The poor innocent tortle :’( ", "-Dustin Hoggman is here and asks them how they feel this landsmeet will go, what they’re hoping to achieve, and news of Auron. Tim finds himself questioning Dustin’s motives and wondering why he is even allowed here. It doesn’t help when Dustin reveals that he is actually holding Solution Ultima, a literal nuke, by his waist. The wizard starts to question Dustin’s sanity and intention but gives up after accepting that he has become accustomed to being surrounded by idiots for the past year.", "-Taylah Swiftwing asks Dig if he’s ready to stand by Europa when needed and wonders if he’s ready to talk about why he was exiled. Dig still refuses to budge because Iain still hasn’t thought of- I mean, Dig is still coming to terms with his past. Fus and Ro are also here with Taylah among some other dragonborn knights.", "-As the party start to take their seats for the beginning of the landsmeet, Lord Wah’ter is pleasantly surprised by a serving girl who spills a whole goblet of wine onto him. This completely soaks the triton’s kimono. Wah’ter maintains his composure but is confused as to the clumsiness of humans. The serving girl looks a bit strange and speaks with a strange lilt. To Dig and Tim, the voice is unmistakable: this was Ked. Ked, as the serving girl, offers to clean Wah’ter’s kimono for him. Wah’ter is intrigued, thinking that a girl was making a move on him and agrees to follow her. Ubo comes along just in case. He smells something fishy and it isn’t the fish pie. Gizzard and Dig also choose to follow, sensing danger.", "The Balcony", "-Aside from the fact that Wah’ter is left extremely disappointed when his paramour takes off her wig to reveal a rather average looking man, the new party members are unsure of who they are dealing with. Only Dig knows what he is getting himself into. ", "-Ked talks to them about the assassination of the King, asks if they are in or out, they plan to reinstate Lux as the heir but as it would cause too much strife in the kingdom they plan to polymorph her into her father. ", "-Speaking of the devil, Lux appears from the shadows to come face to face with the new members. They are left speechless. First off, they don’t know who any of these two are and secondly, they have little hatred for the king because they don’t understand human customs. In any case, this is when Tim comes out onto the balcony after sensing something amiss.", "-Tim puts out the fire on the end of Ked’s cigar. Ked shrugs and lights another one. The wizard berates the Antipathy leader for having such a stupid plan. Having Lux polymorph into her father wouldn’t solve anything and would just cause even more trouble than it is worth. He instead proposes that they kill the King and have Lux be the elected queen. This intrigues Ked, this was not an option that he thought possible. Lux, on the other hand, is furious. Dig and Tim propose that they make the assassination of the king look like a job from the cultists", "-Lux accuses Tim of being morally bankrupt which the wizard immediately thinks is preposterous. After all, Lux was prepared to murder the king anyway. But Lux argues that while she did things for the good of the realm, Tim only ever did things for himself. Tim is confused. What?", "-Wah’ter, Ubo and Gizzard slowly back away as they watch a lovers spat begin to develop. Lux accuses Tim of leaving her even after all she has done for her and that he is nothing but an upstart cutthroat. Tim basically lays down the law on Lux and absolutely destroys her spirit, mind, body, ego, chi, like fucking wrecks her. She breaks down in tears and wonders why nothing ever works out. It seems Lux has some underlying psychological issues. The party later finds out that she used to be sexually abused as a child by the king himself, her father. YIKES ", "-Tim and Dig both agree that the king has to go. He is not only sick in the head but unfit for rule. But the thing is: who are they to decide who lives and who dies? If they commit the murder, the regicide, are they better than those they claim to fight against or the same? Does it make it right to murder someone in cold blood because, in essence, they don’t like him? Hmmmmmmmmmm", "-The party depart the balcony and enter back into the banquet hall for the landsmeet to begin. They get back just in time.", "The Landsmeet Begins", "-The King welcomes everyone: ", "The king’s footsteps echo in the room loudly and obnoxiously as he descends the steps. He is followed by the two young boys you saw earlier. Immediately there is obvious disgust from a lot of the people gathered and you even spot some of the members reaching for their weapons but reconsider. ", "The king beckons you all to take a seat. He speaks. “The Kingdom of Allesia welcomes the Empire’s citizens and its allies from across the seas. Your presence here today proves that you are not only loyal to the realm but are concerned for its security and its continued peace and prosperity. Traditionally in the landsmeet, we would have only the members of the regency council attend. However, I have been informed that they, alongside the dragon emperor Molcam Teranbul, have perished in the flames of Arcabern. So, before we continue, I will ask that each of you appoint a representative from your nation to take a seat on the regency council. They will be the voice of your people and be responsible for their future.”", "-Each of the factions make their choice for their own representative. The figures that are chosen are Ala’din, Musashi, Yurtruz, Arthalas, Vlad, the Allesian king obviously, Old Man Fenrir, Colan Barnette. The dwarves unfortunately don’t choose a representative as King Hrothgar of the dwarves did not actually pledge themselves to the cause. ", "-The first vote for the newly formed regency council is for the inclusion of some other individuals to the council and by extension, to the empire. First off is Lantanis, this passes quite comfortably and Wah’ter becomes a member of the council. Next, the Gymnasian and Europans are offered a chance to be on the council but because they are not really known by the current regency councilors (with the exception of the Boys of course), this motion doesn’t come to pass. The king is especially pleased with this as he is not overly fond of outsiders. ", "-Tim weasels his way to become a member by claiming himself as the last survivor of Felbourne, some ruins now certainly overtaken by the demons to the east. Dig also finds representing the Boys, now comprised of only two members including himself. This particular motion is easy to pass as most of the councilors owe their very lives or states to the Boys. ", "-The King asks the party to introduce the problem from the very beginning. Tim and Dig both explain the dilemma. From all the way to Lucifer to their journey from the west to North Australis. The year long journey. Almost makes me cry just thinking how far they’ve all come :’)", "-Most of the allies do speak good of the party, claiming their bravery and the threat that the enemies possess", "-Tim and Dig warn that the enemy is plotting a regicide and that they should all be careful (8/8 b8 m8)", "First Order of Business", "-Who will lead Australis’ armies and forces. Tim proposes that all of the individual armies will be managed by their respective leaders but that there should be someone that becomes supreme general to overlook everything. Tim puts his brother, Dilmah, up to the task. He can see that Dilmah himself is apprehensive but knowing the general, Tim has no doubt that Dilmah will do his utmost best if he is appointed. Musashi votes for himself, claiming that he is very experienced in battle and has devoted his life to war. Lord Wah’ter votes for himself as the best suited for the task, citing his extensive military pursuits against the underwater threats to Lantanis. ", "-The vote is close between Musashi and General Dilmah. Unfortunately, none of the surface dwellers have much knowledge of Wah’ter’s abilities and go for the safer options. Musashi wins slightly and is declared the Supreme General of the Australis forces. Musashi pledges to do his very best and to vanquish the demons. There is no doubt in the party’s minds that this hobgoblin warlord will perform his duty to the bitter end if need be. ", "Second Order of Business", "-Arthalas argues that the elves were original inhabitants of Australis, especially North Australis, alongside the dwarves. He demands that ownership of Allesia returns to them. Tim reasons with Arthalas that the request is unreasonable and Arthalas seems reluctant to relent. But the elven ranger recognises Tim as a friend to his people and reconsiders this proposal.", "-Arthalas however does condemn the party for being ready to side with vampires (this does come as a shock to Tim and Dig who at this point are still convinced of them being floating slimes). Dig reassures Arthalas that the elves will not have to fight directly with the vampires and their thralls on the battlefield but reminds him that it is a battle against the living and the demons. Arthalas remarks that the vampires aren’t really living anyway but begrudgingly accepts.", "-Last of all, Arthalas is prompted by Andruin to ask about ancient texts which were taken from the elves’ homeland. These books are currently being stored in the Academy and Royal library, which he wants returned to them. Sabrina seems quite annoyed but sees Tim glaring at her and she sighs. Tim proposes that copies are made of the texts while the originals be returned. This motion passes.", "-Tim, Colan and Dig don’t have any requests to make. Colan does make some threatening remarks to the dwarves for the murder of his elven wife though. The king has to intervene before a potential bloodbath.", "Third order of business", "-Gizzard announces the Arafuarians as a part of the Empire and pledges his forces to the cause. He is allowed on the council although many of the members are wary of this lizard man. He looks like a brute, smells and speaks very bad Common. In fact, this entire time he is speaking in fluent draconic (which he seems to be remarkably eloquent in) which Dig translates to Common for everyone else.", "-Gizzard also cheekily requests that Lux and Tim marry each other. This motion is dismissed as folly but somewhere deep down in Tim’s heart, there is a part of him that says YES, I know it. # truelove", "-He also asks for all of Felbourne to be returned to him. Tim is shocked. Gizzard argues that Felbourne rightfully belongs to the swamplands and that because of terra nullis, Gizzard and his peoples were entitled to the land rather than the invaders that came after. An argument ensues between Tim and Gizzard who are both unwilling to let go of their land. Tim doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on (dammit, can’t make that pun anymore), but the council does approve of giving more land to Gizzard. Felbourne, the ruins, would remain with Tim for the time being, however.", "Fourth Order of Business", "-Lord Wah’ter is still a little disappointed that he is not the Supreme General. He does open trade up to the people of Australis as he believes this will benefit both economies. This is readily accepted by everyone on the council. If the quality of the triton force’s armour was anything to go by, the people of Lantanis seem to harbour some great treasures of their own. All the while, Ubo is seen carrying plates of food to his lord from the lower levels to the regency table.", "-Lord Wah’ter requests for assistance against the Kraken if he is to pledge his own armies to the cause. This is quite a reasonable ask and everyone on the council, with the exception of Vlad and Colan, agree to assist Lantanis in their battle against the kraken when the time comes. Lord Wah’ter is satisfied. ", "-There is question among the council of whether Wah’ter truly speaks for his people as he himself admitted that he was but a prince while his king was still in the city. Lord Wah’ter assures everyone that he does speak for Lantanis but there is still doubt in people’s minds. This looked like a power move for an aspiring lord rather than the decision of a wise king.", "-Yurtruz, Fenrir and Vlad don’t seem to have any proposals or requests to make for the time being but no doubt there will be something in the future", "Fifth Order of Business", "-Ala’din wants slavery to be banned in all of Australis. He started with banning it in Namati, his own kingdom for the time being, but now he wanted to extend this to the whole continent. This is met with backlash by Gizzard, King Dawnchaser and Vlad. Ubo and Wah’ter weren’t too particularly shocked because in the city of Lantanis, nobody was a slave and everybody was treated as an equal, provided they swore unwavering fealty to the House of Nekadh. This is a hard motion to pass but eventually it is decided that slavery be abolished. This certainly doesn’t earn the favour of the vampires or the Allesian king.", "-Just like Lantanis, Ala’din opens up trading between the rest of the Empire and the Namati territories.", "-Now the king opens up the discussion to those on the lower levels.", "Sixth Order of Business", "-Dustin reveals to everyone that he has Solution Ultima. This gets everybody in the room extremely nervous as they instinctively reach for their weapons. However, Dustin explains to everyone that the mixture is currently inert and completely under control. He proposes that they use it to destroy the Kraken. Apparently the Gymnasian forces loyal to him were able to cross the Lantanic Ocean which was occupied by the Kraken because he convinced the leader of Gymnasia, who allied himself with the demons, that he was coming to invade Australis. Therefore, he knew that the kraken could not be pierced from the outside as its primordial skin was too thick. Using Solution Ultima, if they could somehow drop it into its mouth, they could blow the creature from within. This gets everybody thinking and a glimmer of hope appears in these dark days", "-Somehow rushes into the room, declaring that they will lead this charge against the kraken. Dig and Tim recognise the woman as Isabella, the woman that Hugh loved and who they encountered back in Galkoorlie before the defence of its walls against the Warband. Isabella explained that she had rebuilt her pirate armada and that she was ready to deliver this Solution Ultima to the kraken. It seems that she is hellbent on revenge and to avenge her dead love, Hugh Mirin. I’m sure that when the party reveals to her that Hugh has been frankenstein’d, she’s going to be extremely mental. Taylah also offers her help but that her ship is unable to fly unless...", "Seventh order of business", "-Taylah wants for the Imperial engineers to assist her in getting her ship back afloat. She takes a long look at Tim, obviously hinting that the Philosopher Stone be used for the good of the draconians. Tim doesn’t say anything but does consider it. Sabrina herself seems to have also pieced together what is going on, confronting Tim with a message spell but being told to be patient in response. The motion is passed and work on repairing the Dragonfly begins.", "-Vice Admiral Prag is brought out and cannot meet the gaze of his Admiral that he betrayed. The fate of Prag is decided by the council who decide that a beheading or hanging is necessary to punish the traitor. There is a vote for who be responsible for dealing the punishment but Taylah doesn’t care, she declares herself as the one to swing the sword.", "Eighth Order of Business", "-Varrus can’t really speak on behalf of the king as he left them but he does request to have access to the soul transferral technology that Panvon was working on. He proposes that the dwarves will be able to make golems out of them by transferring souls into these war machines. Tim himself is entirely against this, not just because he hates technology, but he sees the potential dangers of this being used against them by the enemy or malfunctions. This motion is denied by mostly everyone on the council.", "Intermission", "-An intermission is had as everyone has a break. The king invites the party to his royal bedchambers. The party are wary but also unsure of why King Dawnchaser wants to talk to them. They don’t tarry though.", "-In the king’s bedchamber they find a skeleton on top of his bed which looks like a little girl’s. It is wearing some skimpy clothing. So not only is the king a paedophile but some sort of necrophile too. He doesn’t make a great case for himself. ", "-The King says to them that the next order of business will be to decide on the next Dragon Emperor and that the party will pledge their support to him. The party of course decline his request. However, this is where the King says that it was not a request, but a command. Dig says that there is nothing the king can do to blackmail them into voting for him. This is where they are wrong.", "-The king reveals a cage behind him, which houses Auron, who is now the size of a warhorse. He has tears in his wings, deep cuts all over his body and is incredibly weakened. Tim and Dig had seen enough; they were going to kill this bastard. Dig punches the king with all of his force, sending him toppling to the ground while Tim opens up the cage. Gizzard stands in absolute awe as he sees this golden dragon standing there in front of him. Even in its weakened state, Gizzard is speechless because he was now standing in front of what was a living god to his people. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo, as foreign as they were to the surface, knew the prowess and majesty of a dragon and also bow their head in deference. ", "-This is when Jomoan, Sabrina and Yarrick rush into the room. Tim pleads for Sabrina to heal Auron of his injuries and Sabrina immediately gets to work on healing the damage done to the golden dragon. Jomoan and Yarrick however, immediately get in between Tim, Dig and the king who is now squirming on the ground with a massive black eye. Lord Wah’ter, Ubo and Gizzard here are actually unsure of how to proceed. From their perspective, this king may not have been likeable but the crimes that he committed weren’t really fully understood by their own cultures so this was looking like a cold blooded murder from their allies. They remain standing as they watch the events about to unfold", "-Tim looks at Yarrick, his polearm aimed at him and Dig. He is worried that Yarrick was going to die for his own principles, for this false king. Dig and Tim plead for Yarrick to step aside and for them to kill this evil man. Yarrick says that he has pledged himself to defend the good of the realm. Tim tries to get it into his head that this king was not good for the realm and that he was going to bring down the country with him. Miraculously, Yarrick steps aside, abandoning his sense of honour and instead following his heart. Jomoan likewise moves out of the way (prompting the king to shout a litany of curses in their direction) and stops some Templarus Knights from entering the room (the noise and commotion had drawn some attention down the hallway)", "-Tim and Dig kill the king in a very brutal fashion. Tim grabs a dagger and shanks the king several times while Dig unleashes the fury of his claws and ravages the king’s body. The king lays on the ground, drowning in his own blood, both externally and internally as he gargles and struggles to maintain his breathing. Then King Mikel-Gunner Dawnchaser falls. Tim and Dig get to work making it look like the work of the enemy. ", "-Auron himself, although hurt is very glad to see the party and even takes a liking to the new allies. Tim wonders what sort of monster could hurt such a beautiful creature. Now, however, there was the question of the dragon emperor. The regency council would not need to choose a leader anymore because there was now a dragon who would choose the next leader of the great Australis empire. The party didn’t want to force Auron to choose someone so they decided that upon return to the banquet hall, they would let the dragon choose for itself.", "The Next Dragon Emperor", "-Party declare that the king has been murdered. There is a lot of feigned sadness here and some genuine shock from others. Vlad licks his lips, recognising the situation and probably ascertaining the truth there in the instant. Luckily, it seems that the late king wasn’t that well loved and none dare to question the party ", "-The party then introduce Auron and those who were previously unaware of Auron are immediately in awe and bow to the dragon. There is no lack of respect or deference given to Auron as all here recognise the true significance of the creature. The party declare that Auron will decide on the next Dragon emperor.", "-Auron shifts between Lux and Dig. In the dragonborn’s heart there is some desire to become the Emperor, to have all this power, to be responsible for the future of the Australis people. Dig felt that Auron chose him because of fate but the actual reason was closer to the fact that Dig was the one always treating Auron to gold pieces when the party wasn’t looking. Still, Dig shakes his head and tells Auron that he was responsible for choosing the right person. This is where Auron moves from the table all the way to the opposite end of the hall to a cloaked figure... to Lux.", "-There is a long pause as Lux pulls back her hood to reveal her long, blonde locks and plain but pretty face. She looks regal even in her current attire. She looks around stunned as others now fall to their knees. ", "“All hail the Dragon Empress! All hail Empress Lux!”", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

One is the sound of the royal orchestra with a chorus of trumpets and horns singing to the beat of marching drums that match the pace of your own beating heart. The other is the sound of absolute jubilation, thousands of people- some misty-eyed, some excitedly roaring, others gripped with mania- scrambling past each other, kids leaping onto each other’s shoulders to catch a glimpse, to hopefully get a view… of the new Dragon Empress. ", "Your party are currently in a procession, a march for the coronation of Lux as the leader of the Australis Empire. Confetti and bouquets of flowers litter the cobblestone floor that you and a host of delegates are marching on. You focus on the soft crunches of your footsteps so as to not get overwhelmed by the intensity of this bellowing crowd. Joining you are members of the Regency council, Templarus Knights lined up on your flanks with their usual ceremony and pomp and of course her magnificence, Lux, seated in a royal coach pulled by two white mares. Auron sits inside the coach on Lux’s lap, where he is safe from view from the general public for now.", "-Tim and Dig are satisfied with this crowd. Usually in their earlier days the crowd would be a mixed bag- largely due to the influence of the greenskins that they use to call companions. Now, the crowd is completely on board with the Boys, even as diminished as their numbers are. ", "-Gizzard and Ubo generally feel indifferent to these people while Wah’ter continues to spout propaganda about Lantanis. ", "Some of your allies look a bit flustered from the whole spectacle, especially the elves who have likely never been around this many humans before. They are likely remembering what happened the LAST time this many humans got in contact with elves. Vlad, the mysterious vampire count from Sylvania, is unreadable as his hood covers most of his face and he avoids the brilliant sun. For once, you see Colan Barnette, the jarl of West Australis smiling. Perhaps the jarl is finally seeing hope or perhaps he simply enjoys the attention of the young girls flashing their breasts for the handsome Ala’din as he walks by with his Namati flair.", "In any case, you begin to ascend a long flight of stairs, high up into the firmament. You eventually reach the top of the massive walls, finding yourselves staring down into a sea of people. From left to right, you have a good view of the overcrowded copper quarter streets, the mesmerising colours and exotic wares of the bronze quarter markets, the opulence and splendour of the silver quarter nobility, and far in the distance sits the Ivory Keep against the azure expanse. As the rest of the escort lines up on the wall with Templarus knights standing guard behind them, you see Lux finally emerging from within her cocoon. Some templarus knights offer to help her dismount but she holds her hand out and refuses, instead nimbly exiting the carriage with the grace of a swan. ", "She takes slow and pronounced steps to the edge of the wall as Sabrina and Jomoan join her by her side. She then holds her hands out and speaks to all gathered here for her coronation ceremony. Sabrina casts a thaumaturgy spell and this makes Lux’s voice not only audible to the crowd about fifty feet below you but also take on a more regal colour.", "“The last time I was here in the city of Windar I was but the illegitimate daughter of our late king, scared from the world I was born into and forced into hiding. I saw a crippled nation. I saw a scattered Empire devoid of its soul. I saw a people starving, neither for food nor water, neither land nor conquest, but for the promise of a future. And like many of you gathered here today, I had almost lost hope. ", "But here we are today. A land of societies old and new, races different in history and origins but all, by the grace of the god’s, united now in spirit and in aim. Yes, it is true. The rumours that you have heard are all true. Demons and creatures with no right to exist outside of nightmares, now march upon our lands from across the Yarrum. They rape, they ravage and they relish our fear but I say it is THEY that should fear. For we have something that they do not. We have… THE BOYS AND THEIR ALLIES!” Lux smiles to your party and gestures for you to all step forward.", "-The party introduce themselves to the city formally, which sparks even more celebration from the crowd. Dig parts to the people a few words, promising to vanquish the demons and for everyone to rest assured. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo take the mic and loudly proclaim the glory of... you guessed it, Lantananatnatis.", "“The ceremonies you have seen today are ancient and some of their origins are veiled in mists of the past. In those days we would look to the skies and see living gods, divinity made incarnate. I am talking about the dragons, those mighty and beautiful creatures that would soar above us in the stars. Well, loyal citizens of the Empire, people of Australis, today I announce to you as the Dragon Empress, that we have with us the last dragon of Thera! Auron!”", "-The crowd’s reaction to Auron is mixed with reverence, fear, excitement and general WTF. Tim is proud at the sight as being a native of Australis, he especially sees the significance of the young golden dragon. Hope is renewed in the land. ", "“In conclusion, I wish to assure you all that my coronation is a declaration of our hopes for the future. I swear to you as your new queen and empress that we will beat back these demons. We will take back the lands that they have stolen from us and UNITED, WE WILL TRIUMPH! AUSTRALIS INVICTA!”", "The crowd’s cries drown out the fireworks that Varrus and his dwarves generously provided for the occasion. They chant in unison with the exploding streams of light, “Long live the queen. Long live the Empress!” ", "-Lux, who is presiding over the entire spectacle, rewards the party with bags of gold- Dig of course getting the most. ", "-Rest of the speech is Lux reading out the changes that the Dragon Council (not regency) has made during landsmeet. She also mentions changes to taxes, slavery, trade and so forth. ", "COLOSSEUM BATTLE", "-There are festivities happening all around the city with discounted goods at the markets, sweets, fireworks, the whole lot as the city goes ablaze with excitement. Most of the people however, have gone to the colloseum for some good old bloodsport. Bloodsport which is obliged by the party who decide that today is the day they test their wits and might against each other.", "-The party decide on an one for all approach where anyone is fair game. It should be mentioned that Lord Wah’ter takes special delight in fighting against his bodyguard/lover Ubo, a bit too much delight", "-The battle starts with the Triton prince conjuring a fog across the whole arena. This makes it not only near impossible for the fighters to see where they are going or swinging, but what is even more perilous is the fact that the wizard casts black tentacles (I like where this is going) all over the ground. ", "-The party stumbles for a long time while they struggle to get their footing and find the other people. Eventually, Lord Wah’ter decides to let the fog up and the battle truly begins. It seems that Gizzard himself corners Dig into a corner and begins to brutalise the sorcerer. The savagery of the lizard’s attacks initially stuns Dig, who can do little but hold on. The sorcerer attempts to phase shift out, but the panic and hte overwhelming aura of Gizzard causes him to fail momentarily", "-Ubo gets to work on the rear of Gizzard (not what you’re thinking). He uses his long quarterstaff to great effect, striking the lizard from behind. Some might call this cowardly, but Ubo has been harbouring quite some resentment towards the lizard for his quips and threats about tortle soup and melting his shell. ", "-Tim remains on the outskirts of the battle casting fireballs and other magical goodies which almost incinerates the other party members. At this point the crowd wonders whether this is a friendly exhibition match or these guys really want to end each other’s life. ", "-Lord Wah’ter is constantly jumping up and down in the air while striking with his trident. The way he battles it looks like he is a hornet striking with its stinger. A scary sight indeed except... then the crowd hears a mighty roar", "-Dig has polymorphed himself into King Kong, well a giant ape but basically you get the picture. This guy was on the brink of death but turns it all around with mighty swings at Gizzard (who was alreayd weakened by Ubo’s devastating attacks). Gizzard falls unconscious and is magically transported by Sabrina to the medical bay. Tim likewise falls victim to the relentless ape who runs him down like a pig. The poor wizard was only just again getting used to being on two feet and he is smacked into oblivion by Dig. Oh and did I mention that because the blink spell of Dig was still running, the ape was sometimes phasing in and out of existence lmao.", "-Ubo and Lord Wah’ter continue to have an epic fight against each other. Ubo hides in his shell every time Wah’ter hurtles down full throttle. Eventually his shell cracks (HAHA!) and Ubo loses to his master. ", "-Wah’ter does fairly well against Dig and on his good day might even triumph against the simian considering his extensive experience against large creatures. But he is already exhausted by the time he comes to this battle and Dig puts him out of his misery. The crowd goes wild as they chant the name of Dig.", "2. The Dragon Council", "THE COUNCIL ASSEMBLES", "-While the people of Windar are still in celebration, the rest of the party meet with the Dragon Council inside a Cabinet room now turned into the meeting place ", "-The council prepares to discuss their next moves.", "-Before the party sits down, Dilmah apologises for not accepting mantle to Tim.

Now that we have indulged ourselves in celebration, we must now get to business.” He motions for Sakura to pour everyone some sake as he continues. “As Supreme General, it is my duty to ensure that we are all on board for the land campaign. Everyone gathered here today knows the threat that these demons possess, that they are truly a terrible force to be reckoned with. They know only destruction, death and causing havoc but make no mistake, they are a cunning enemy as well.

Its tentacles could coil around an entire armada and crush it as easy as you and I would crush an ant. And I don’t even want to know what’s UNDERNEATH the water. Say, Lord Wah’ter and Ubo. You’ve faced the kraken. Tell the Council what that was like?”", "-The two of them don’t realise but their description of the kraken differs greatly to the recounts of all the other survivors. This is because what the Lantanis forces faced was simply one of the kraken’s many tentacles. Barnabus explains to everyone at the table that the kraken is larger than they can imagine. You see, each of the primordial creature’s tentacles are a sea creature themselves. This should give you a perspective on the foe that you will be facing.

It is not the largest ship by any means and judging from the Jolly Roger on the flag, it is definitely not part of the Imperial Navy. This is a pirate ship, more specifically a galleon. It is this large square-rigged sailing ship with six masts, the keel and frames consist of oak but you can see soft cedar wood for the planking. The ship’s figurehead catches your eye because it is no other than a golden dragon made of a bronze alloy. This must be Isabella’s ship.", "The sight of the ‘Fat Lady’ as it bobs up and down over the ebbing waters of the deep blue ocean is a serene one. This flagship of the Stormblood Pirates is already impressive in of itself, with its sixed rigged masts, dark oak wood hull and its imposing gold dragon figurehead, but it is the vast array of battle ready ships you now have at your disposal which is truly incredible.

Before long, the entire dock population is chanting out your names, “Long live the Boys! Long live the alliance!”", "Isabella claps with excitement, a wide smile drawn across her face. “My, my! It would seem that you are quite popular with the common folk. If Hugh could see this now…” she visibly chokes back a few tears. “Well, have you all that you need for the journey? The ships leave on my command so you have time.”", "The party shake their heads. They are ready.", "-The party is generally hyped at going on this new adventure.

", "“Wait for me!”", "You can hardly believe your eyes. You see Yarrick Danton, the Halfling Paladin with a knapsack slung over his shoulder and racing through the crowd towards the pier. Unfortunately, not only is he weighed down in his full plate armour but his stubby little legs can only take him so far. So by the time he reaches where your ship was docked, you are already about 200 metres out. You watch Yarrick take about thirty desperate little steps back and realise what he is about to try to do.

Then with an accompanying roar he jumps!", "He’s not making the distance.", "-Yarrick sinks to the bottom of the sea and begins to drown. Gizzard is the one who acts, diving deep below to save this halfling- but not out of the kindness of his heart. It was actually the work of Tim’s wizardry, which conjured images of Yarrick being the saviour of the swamplands which spurred the lizardfolk on. Tim remembers to keep this trick up his sleeve; that is, playing with the mind of his companion for his own nefarious purposes.", "-Yarrick passes out from exhaustion and is taken to the infirmary along with his bag of goodies", "Isabella massages her forehead. “That’s enough excitement for the morning. Now, your quarters are on the lower deck, watch your head as you go down the step ladder especially you mages.

On the High Seas: The First Day", "INTRODUCTIONS AND GIFTS", "A few hours have passed since you set sail. Isabella assures you that you’ve made good progress. Yarrick has also awoken and everybody is called onto deck. There are a lot of crewmembers and pirates that don’t pay you much heed as you step into the sunlight. This is hardly surprising, there’s probably a hundred of these pirates on this ship alone. Since the entire armada is in a spearhead formation, you have innumerable ships that are ready to cover your rear while you act as the point of this formation. Isabella calls your party to the deck and soon you and some others are gathered in a circle near the ship’s forecastle. Isabella, Yarrick and three others you have not yet met stand alongside you.", "When Yarrick sees you all he yells, “My favourite people in all of Thera! Isn’t this exciting? I’ve never been aboard a ship before, oh gods but there’s all this water and wind and sails and ships. How many ships do you think are behind us, fifty, a hundred, a thousand! Akatosh be praised I think there might be!”", "Tim takes a proper look. “I’d say more like fifty but...”", "“Well I almost feel bad for whoever is facing the heroes of witchfield!” He looks to the new party members. “And I’m sure you’re all heroes where you come from. Gods I still haven’t gotten used to that you know, being called a hero…”", "Dig nods. “It is quite self-gratifying isn’t it?”", "Isabella coughs and interrupts the Halfling, who is obviously still in amazement. “The Boys and Co, I’d like you to meet my close… associates. Jasin, Mina and Rozo. Jasin is the ship’s cook and by cook I mean a culinary extraordinaire. Mina is the best navigator on these nine seas and this one here is Rozo, my first mate.”", "Each of the party members introduce themselves in turn, save for Gizzard who simply offers a few grunts of indifference.", "Jasin has a tall, slender frame and despite his legs being a bit too long for his torso he is quite handsome, with his shortly cropped blonde hair and neatly groomed beard. He waves his hand dismissively and says. “If that’s all captain, I’ve got some cooking to do. Welcome aboard the ‘Fat Lady’, enjoy your stay and all that. I’ll be in the kitchen.” He takes his leave.", "Regarding Mina, the first thing you notice is her ample bust. They would put watermelons to shame. That’s not even accounting for a slim waistline, her generous behind, and her fire-orange hair that’s wrapped around her neck. You notice Yarrick’s eyes glazed over as he can’t seem to keep his eyes off her. ", "The party smirks. “Mah nigguh.”", "Mina herself doesn’t seem all too interested in this spectacle. She looks to her captain. “Issy, I’m gonna make sure we don’t sail off course this early into the journey. I’d rather not have to swim back to shore.” Isabella nods and Mina turns her attention to Lord Wah’ter and Ubo. “We’ve got some things to discuss later. I’ll be in the navigation room. Come see me.” She gives a little wink to Yarrick but it’s so quick you don’t even know if it really happened. Yarrick collapses onto the ground. ", "Rozo on the other hand seems increasingly interested in Gizzard. Gizzard, you can see him sizing you and up down and after a few moments he seems to be somewhat disappointed as he looks away and sighs. ", "Gizzard surprisingly couldn’t care less, instead trying to perform some backstrokes in the water in order to show his gleaming abs. Unfortunately, he fails to do so due to a combination of poor lighting and the fact that he had just had quite a large meal. As a result, not only does he fail to display his masculinity but he also embarrasses himself greatly in front of a challenger. Gizzard would commit sepuku if he could.Isabella interrupts. “I didn’t call you up here just for introductions. Yarrick had some things for all of you I believe.”", "Yarrick grins proudly as he dumps the knapsack onto the floor to unveil everything within. “The reason I was late today was because everyone was giving me gifts to give to you guys. The gods have truly blessed us today. Let’s have a look here.” ", "-Yarrick hands some gifts to each of the party members:", "-Tim gets The Elderwood Staff: This staff is made of a wood found only in the Banksia World Tree which is able to inherently store magical energy. It is traditionally passed down to those of Magister rank in the Academy. ", "Yarrick then turns to Dig and hands to you what looks like a navy blue robe. You rub it in your hands, expecting it to feel like silk but instead, you find that it feels almost like chainmail. Yarrick says, “This was a gift from Taylah. She said that the royal dragonborn mages back in Europa all wear this.” ", "-So Dig gets the Ironsilk Robe: It’s made from a special silk weaved from a spider in Europa known as the Iron Widow. It has no equal in all of Thera and is exclusively worn by mages in the Dragonborn Empire.", "Yarrick’s excitement fades when he picks up a ruby coloured ring and looks at Gizzard. He slowly makes his way up to the lizardfolk barbarian and gingerly reaches out his hand to you. “From the Templarus Order, Jomoan thought you should have this. It’s a demonic artefact but it’s been purified... mostly.”", "-Gizzard is given the Challenging Ring: The ring itself on the surface appears to be an ordinary red ring. However, putting it on you feel a surge of power like a barbarian’s rage.", "-Ubo is given an Elemental Staff: This elemental staff is made of the same material as the Banksia World Tree itself, before it succumbed to decay due to the death of the Ancient One. The staff is attuned to Ubo and reacts to his elemental will. ", "-As for Lord Wah’ter, Yarrick reaches into the bag and gives him an egg. No one knows what egg it is but it was a gift from the dwarves apparently and found in the Badlands. Lord Wah’ter regards the egg for a moment, it is red, hot to the touch and covered in swirling flame-like patterns. He decides that he will give it to his main man Ubo to cook it for later. Brilliant. ", "THE DUEL", "-A pirate’s duel between Gizzard and Rozo begins. Rozo insisted on it and Gizzard wasn’t even too fussed to begin with but decides to humour the pirate warrior. Isabella at some point wants to step in and stop this but she must also respect the pirate’s code. A pirate’s duel was to the death and just because Gizzard was a Player Character didn’t mean he was invincible. ", "-Rozo actually gets mauled for the majority of it and this is because halfway into the bout he is thrown into the water by Gizzard’s overpowering strength. However, just before the ending blow, something activates within Rozo and he takes on the form of a multi-armed being (basically one of those 9 armed indian gods lol) and he starts pummeling the ever living crap out of Gizzard. Of course, Gizzard uses his Challenging Ring and performs ten swings of his own weapon at blinding speeds which completely incapacitates Rozo. Instead of killing the pirate, Gizzard shows him mercy (in relative terms) by chomping off the pirate’s right sword-arm and devouring it. ", "-Rozo tries to remain standing but passes out from blood loss and Isabella hurries him below deck to seek further treatment. ", "Isabella says. “All the fun aside, lunch will be ready in an hour. I hope you all eat fish.” She grins at the triton and tortle.", "Ubo frowns. “Why does everyone always make fun of the Aquans, huh?”", "EXPLORING THE SHIP", "-Later, Gizzard would visit Rozo in the infirmary to hear:", "Rozo remarks, “I haven’t had a fight like that in years. Your allies have found a powerful warrior in you. A bit slow in the head maybe but your swinging arm definitely makes up for it.” ", "-In the kitchen, Ubo and Jasin have a cook off. Ubo cooks some otherwordly dish and by otherwordly I mean it was like some New York Strip or some shit lmfao. Jasin decides to google a few dishes and also present them as his own, but I’m pretty sure I looked up some Jamie Oliver dish for it. In any case, the (UNBIASED) judge was Lord Wah’ter, who tasted both entries and ruled that Ubo was the better cook- Iron Chef style. ", "-In the kitchen the aquans are also prepared to cook this egg, but first they place it into the fireplace to see what sort of reaction it would produce. To their surprise, a creature known as a phoenix bursts out of the egg and begins setting fire to the wooden floorboards as it tramples about. The three of them in the kitchen are amazed to see this creature as none of its kind have been spotted since the days of antiquity (The Last Phoenix anyone?). The triton prince puts out his hand to coax the creature onto his arm but instead he is burnt by the intense heat put out by this baby phoenix. As Wah’ter lets out a small high pitched yelp from the pain he attempts to grab the creature again anyway but this time the creature flies around the kitchen, knocking over pots and pans, before flying out an open window. Meanwhile, Gizzard is still performing backstrokes in the open water and thinking about how he failed to display his six-pack, thus he doesn’t notice the phoenix flying in the skies above. ", "-Dig attempts to go into the Captain’s Quarters. No one is sure whether Dig was genuinely interested in talking with Isabella or if he had other intentions in mind. In any case, when Dig knocks on Isabella’s door, he gets turned away and told to go to the common room. ", "-In the Map Room, Mina was seen just tending to her maps. She explains that her life goal is to map out the entire world and so is interested to know more about the architecture of Lantanis. Ubo and Wah’ter do not provide much as most of this knowledge was considered a state secret. But they do assure her that they are heading in the right general direction. ", "A WELCOME REPRISE", "-Common room where the people are all playing games. Two of the most popular games seemed to be a drinking game called Dwarves Bane and another being Squirrel racing. ", "In the Dwarves Bane, they had to each offer a wager and drink round after round until only one man was left standing. One of the catches was that one of the rounds would simply be a mug of piss, literally. So the first round starts and Wah’ter is immediately knocked out- the triton is sent to bed so that he can recover. He probably wasn’t used to surface drinks yet which is quite surprising consider his body is probably made up of more water than these terrestial guys. In any case, eventually only Dig is left standing. A gladiator in both the coliseum and the booze it would seem. Tim would later argue that Dig only won because most of the drinks he had were straight up piss but we’ll save that for another day", "-As for the squirrel races, the closest to winning was Tim who named it... Failed Marriage? Marriage Dysfunction? Honestly forgot. The winner was actually a random pirate who decided to join in on the fun. However, Dig’s Eye of Melora reacted and this revealed to the entire party that the pirate was cheating. His squirrel was actually a giant cockroach (loooooooooooooooool) that outruns all squirrels. Ok... so hear me out here boys. A cockroach runs like super fast considering it’s size, so in this world of Thera what if there was a cockroach the size of a squirrel, yeah? Entirely plausible pls", "-They deal with the cheater by Gizzard eating both of the guy’s hands. Funnily enough, this pirate chose this option rather than admitting to Isabella that he cheated. This not only provided insight as to the sort of ‘honour’ that these thieves had, but also what kind of captain Isabella might be.

Dustin greets the party and Isabella asks them to fill them in on events briefly since the siege of Galkoorlie, and what their most memorable moments have been so far. The party give her a rundown of the journey so far.", "-Isabella discussed her desire for vengeance ever since Hugh’s death and that she had been amassing a crew to destroy this kraken. She asked what Hugh was like? The party tell her a bit about the bard and his involvement in the crew. Dustin also appeared to want to mention something but holds it for the next session, I mean next time. ", "-She takes relief in the fact that Hugh is now resting peacefully in his crypt in the Namati desert. Dig, Tim and Dustin look at each other awkwardly as obviously this was not the case. Hugh was now a flesh golem being used as a psionic puppet by Yoshimitsu. They chose not to tell Isabella this, afraid of how she might react.", "-What is Lantanis like? The House of Nekadh? Ubo’s hometown? Wah’ter this time takes great pride to talk about Lantanis for hours and hours. Everyone had all but fallen asleep by the time the third hour had come. He didn’t mention much about his family; the ruling family of Lantanis. Ubo then explained that the tortle’s didn’t really have a home city as such as they were travelling nomads and most had settled down in Lantanis, alongside most of the other inhabitants of the deep sea. ", "-Dustin does a quick run through of Solution Ultima again and reassures Tim that Taylah might not necessarily explode the ship. He is quite chuffed with the fact that Tim does not have the Philosopher’s Stone anymore; probably a tinge of jealousy there. No one in the party was impressed with the fact that Dustin always carried this superweapon everywhere so nonchalantly. ", "-Dustin asks of Prince Gizzard’s plans for the swamps and if he was worried that they hadn’t responded? Gizzard doesn’t seem to concerned and cited that the people of the swamp were a hardy folk. However, everyone could see that deep down there was some anxiousness from the lizardman- the demons had gone through the swamps after all so there was no intel on that area for now. ", "-The party was asked whether they would be able to deal with Styx and Saroza when the time came. Dig and Tim were both resolute in their answers. There would be little to no mercy for the two traitors. ", "-The final discussion point for the party was whether the three newcomers had any plans for joining the Boys. They beat around the bush a lot and did not give any definitive answers for the time being, but they were hopeful for the future and didn’t outright refuse, so this was a good sign.", "Isabella says, “Now, you should all get some rest. Mina tells me that we should reach the drop location on the night of the third day. Then we will reach the fabled lost city.”", "Dustin also remarks, “Yes, I should be on the way back to my ship now. Today was sirens, who knows what tomorrow might bring.”", "NIGHTMARES", "-Rest for the night and each of them experience a nightmare (change to nightmare page)Tim took a special liking towards his own squirrel and decided to keep it in his room.

What do you do?", "-Tim and Dig get to work on finding the holes in the room. They first vapourise all of the water with their fire magic before sealing the gaps. Tim takes special care to make sure his squirrel doesn’t drown in this mess. Barnabus is frantic, yelling at Tim for being so deep asleep that even he couldn’t wake the wizard up.", "-Gizzard and Ubo were in the same room but weren’t too fussed with the water. Instead, they were eager to see what was happening outside. As they break out of the door:", "It’s the sound of fighting! It’s down the hallway where the kitchen is. You hear a familiar voice cry out, it’s Jasin.", "-They rush through the hallway and find in the common room that Jasin has been stabbed and he is dying. There are sahuagin lying around him as well as dead pirates", "-Jasin laughed that they took their time and that no matter what they did they wouldn’t wake up. Offers them some potion and then dies in Ubo’s arms. Ubo thankfully didn’t have much attachment to the man yet but respectfully lays him to rest.

Its scales are dark gray, festooned with seaweed, barnacles, lampreys and other sea life. Its maw is the size of a wagon, with teeth the size of greatswords.

Yarrick almost drowns to death but the tritons help him out in the end- barely", "-Meanwhile the rest of the party finally get to work on the sea serpent. Wah’ter is in the air for most of the battle, essentially stinging and retreating, like some real muhammad ali type shit", "-Unfortunately the shipbreaker is unable to be stopped as it goes in to break the ship, but justs before it does a force field appears around the ship absorbing the impact just long enough for Taylah and the Dragonfly to appear. The manticore cannon does massive damage to the creature and it eventually is finished by the Boys. Wyvern riders also come down and destroy the minions “That’s twice now, Boys!” she screams.", "-The party get some supplies from the creature which range from one of its scales to be used as some sort of armour piece probably, as well as some of the flesh inside which Ubo will use to cook up a feast", "*I’ve now learnt from this encounter that I need to put less NPCs in or enemies because one round took like ten minutes lmao. Don’t worry boys, always learning yeet*", "AFTER THE BATTLE", "-Have all important allies (Taylah, Toothless, Dustin and Yarrick) aboard the Fat Lady. They have a short tally of the forces lost.", "-Toothless guarding the door while eating a fish, offers some to the party. It seems to be grateful for the boys saving its life from the Springs of Allesia.", "-Isabella mourning the loss of Jasin ", "-So they go into a room where Taylah, Dustin and Yarrick are. But also alongside them are two very familiar figures; Panvon and Unit A.B. They leave the party with these two to have a long chat.", "The Halfling doesn’t seem to put much resistance, it seems he has accepted his fate regardless and is simply telling you what he believes to be his own truth. “Losing my wife was the end of me. Tell me, all of you, have you ever truly loved?”", "Most of the party shrugs. Tim says, “If we go by your definitions, probably not.”", "The halfling smirks. “No. None of you have never experienced true love. How could you? You’re all so young.” ", "Gizzard was certainly not young. What was this flesh bag talking about?", "“Well, all my life I was ridiculed, spat on by the humans and even my own kind. No one believed in me and my silly inventions. No one but Abigail. She always told me that I was going to be the greatest inventor in Windar. She called me… her own little genius. So why? Why were the gods so cruel that they took her away from me?”", "“Are you going to make this a pity story, old man?” Dig questions. “You’re trying to justify murder.”", "“You... you don’t understand. I could bring her back- my sweet Abby. The body was easy enough, synthetics and metals to simulate the corporeal husk. The mind wasn’t too complicated either, just a series of algorithms and computational loops but… the soul.” He chuckles to himself. “Even the most skilled necromancer couldn’t truly bring a soul back.” Panvon edges his face to each of the party members, eyeing them each firmly. “Except the Oni. He promised me that the dark lord could. All I had to do in return was make more of these warforged. Is… is that truly evil?”", "The wizard replies with a solid, “Yes.”", "Lord Wah’ter folds his arms. He isn’t that accustomed to humans and their values here on the surface but murder is murder. He remains silent and Ubo does likewise.", "“Tell me, heroes. If one of you was to fall in battle someday and the rest of your companions were given the option to kill a few hundred for the ability to bring that member back. Would you do it?”", "Dig immediately thinks of Hugh. Was he capable of doing what Panvon did? ", "Tim once again responds. “Nothing you say is justification for the murdering of innocents. This is black and white, old man.”", "“Hmph. Then all I can say is this. Yes. I killed. I killed to bring back someone I loved. And if you decide to execute me then you are perhaps wiser than I. I only ask that you spare A.B. for she has done nothing wrong.”", "The party contemplate this.", "Unit A.B. has been quiet this entire time but speaks. “Question: What will become of the creator and this unit?”", "-Unit A.B. suggested that they spare Master Panvon if he created the resin to coat all the ships. Master Panvon now realised that he had a bargaining chip. He stated that he didn’t require the tortle shells but only Tim’s regrown foot (used tortle shell to create the potion).", "-Tim was absolutely adamant that they would not be using his foot. Instead, the party tell Taylah, Yarrick and Dustin to detain Yarrick for the time being. Ubo suggested that they leave Panvon on an island somewhere or abandon him on another continent but the Boys both considered this risky because the demons would probably take Panvon to create warforged for their side. Therefore, the party agreed that it was best to have him be a prisoner for now and help the allies before giving him a fair trial. That being said, it was fairly obvious to everyone what his fate would be at the end of all of this. He was a dead man. ", "-The party now had to deal with Unit A.B. and her fate. She was a warforged and only acted according to her master/creator’s orders. But was she only machine or was she something more. Unit A.B. discusses some things with the party:", "Unit A.B. cocks her head to one side as she stands awfully close to you. “This unit has been thinking a lot of recent events and conversations with Bickman and the Boys. This unit has 5 questions.”", "1. Can a machine have intelligence?", "-Master Panvon has outfitted her with the most sophisticated memory bank, challenges Tim to how many magical words he can memorise", "-She wants to conclude that intelligence is easily simulated but Tim disagrees, claiming that this is not true intelligence", "2. Can a machine have emotions?", "-Mental states are just implementations of the right algorithmic program.", "-Asks Ubo if he would do anything to protect his lord? She would do the same for Panvon (she said not because of program but because she wants to) ", "-She feels sad that they don’t accept her", "-She feels sad that Master Panvon is searching for something he will never attain", "3. Can a machine be original or creative?", "-Reasoning is nothing but reckoning", "-Self-improving AI that always learns", "-Asks Dig about his ability to mould spells with his creativity and talent, she says that she could also change some of her programming; was this not creativity?", "4. Can a machine be benevolent or hostile?", "-If the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, then reproducing the behaviour of the nervous system with a physical device should be possible", "-Asks Gizzard why he chooses not to be hostile to these people even though analysing his brain wave patterns, it seems that he has an intense rage within him at all times", "-Unit A.B. she also chooses to be benevolent", "5. Can a machine be self-aware?", "-Unit A.B. asks Wah’ter what he thinks of the fish and other aquatic creatures that swim in the sea by Lantanis. What about the mentally disabled? Do you still regard them as human?", "-This produces a dilemma", "-She closes her eyes and struggles but then says. “Because even though this… unit… is not human… this…” “I AM ALIVE!” ", "-The party finds out that Unit A.B. has something called a Soul Capacitor and that multiple souls are housed in there, including some of the original Abby (Panvon’s dead wife). This means that she is now... something more. Not human, not machine. A monstrosity.", "-The party are now faced with a dilemma. What to do with Unit A.B...", "1. Tim, Ubo and Wah’ter are in favour of ending Unit A.B. once and for all", "2. Dig wants to try and free the souls and to have Unit A.B. continue to choose her own path", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

Afraid of the thought that you might soon terminate her existence? Does she even feel at all? She CLAIMS to be self-aware but how can you be sure? In the end, she’s given you the decision to make. What will you do with her?", "-Tim seemed to have no qualms killing Unit A.B. outright. He refused to acknowledge the possibility of her having gained consciousness and didn’t believe that this abomination should continue living", "-Gizzard was somewhat perplexed- not because of any moral dilemma but rather that the lizardfolk was finding it difficult to comprehend this idea of a robot (warforged). Still, strength recognises strength and Gizzard could tell that Unit A.B. was formidable as an ally so he leant towards sparing her.", "-Ubo’s main concern was the fact that Unit A.B. was harbouring “dozens” of souls. He doesn’t care much about what happens to Unit A.B. so long as the souls within are either freed or finally put to rest", "-Lord Wah’ter, actually no, Boyd suggested that we turn Unit A.B. into some C3PO bullshit backpack. Watch yourself boy, the nerf hammer will be around the corner and it’s coming for your ass if you keep up these antics >:)", "-Dig is the true champion of the people. Some might call him a white knight but I think that Dig is just a nice guy TM. Unfortunately this isn’t going to get him laid with Unit A.B. but it does show that there is still some hope for her to not be brutally destroyed by the party. Dig suggested a soul de-limiter that would control and free souls within her capacitor (the group proceeded to argue about the nomenclature for about thirty minutes while Unit A.B. stood patiently).", "Unit A.B. does not waver in the face of potential death, if it even can be called that. “I do not know what will happen. Perhaps the souls granted me what was missing or perhaps they never made a difference. If you wish to free the souls then I will not step in your way. That is my choice. However, only my creator will be able to make such a device so it is he that you must convince.”", "-Eventually the party decided that they would keep Unit A.B. alive as a potential ally but needed to approach Master Panvon in order to create this device. The souls would be ‘freed’ eventually but they would need to decide whether to ‘bleed’ them out little by little or remove the souls all at once. You see, no one was sure of what impact these souls had on Unit A.B. and if by removing these souls whether it’d affect her irreparably. For now, they were content with keeping her at bay.", "-The party exited the Captain’s quarters where in the hallway they spotted Isabella rubbing her eyes. She had obviously been crying. She expressed that this war has seen the loss of too many close friends, not only Jasin. ", "-Apparently only 3 ships were lost in the battle with the Shipbreaker- which was a miracle when you think about it. ", "-Party go to their quarters and rest for the night. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo floated on the seas as they slept and end up spooning one another. This seemed to be a regular occurrence and had the triton bodyguards talking. Rumours were abound but none dare questioned a highborn of the House of Nekadh. ", "-Tim made great strides in his research of the pocket plane that he recently discovered. He was focusing largely on the amount of magical energy input required to enter and maintain one’s form within the plane. Barnabus was especially excited at Tim’s progress.", "-Admiral Swiftwing visited Dig in the party’s quarters and offered to look at his wounds. She even gave him a letter from the Emperor of Europa which not only offered him 500 gold pieces but formally recognised him as a citizen of Europa once more. ", "-Taylah and Dig share some private moments walking around the ship and making small talk. Unfortunately, Taylah was acting very strangely and things quickly turned south with the numerous awkward silences that eventuated from this. Taylah would have spent her entire life being groomed for war and command so she likely experienced very little of things like courtship and such. If she harboured any feelings for Dig, it would have to remain unrequited and unchecked for a time until this whole demon thing was over.", "-btw, Gizzard is now holding a sea serpent scale on his back and Ubo is carrying a large chunk of sea serpent meat. Realistically, they should probably be put in Tim’s bag of holding but I’ll let them figure that out on their own ;)", "~~~", "The Ghost Ships", "Looking out into the blue skies, this would be just another normal, sunny, beautiful day. But standing on the deck of The Fat Lady alongside your companions, you can’t help but notice that the mood seems a bit sombre, especially on those of the pirates. Although you didn’t know Jasin for very long, you can tell that he was someone quite dear to them because right now his corpse is laid on a wooden paddle boat. The boat is ordained with laurel wreaths, gold, jewellery and even some cooking utensils have been laid beside him. With a small push, Isabella sends the boat into the distance and Lord Wah’ters bodyguards drift to the side to make way. ", "-Tim and Dig respectfully bow their heads as the boat continued to paddle on. They didn’t really have any sentimental attachment to the man but they showed appreciation for the fallen all the same. They were all in the same struggle, after all. ", "-Gizzard watched on at this strange human ceremony. To the lizardfolk, it would have been strange that the living were going to such extreme lengths for something that was no longer even alive. Practical? Hardly.", "Isabella then wipes a few tears away with the cuff of her sleeve and hands a bow and arrow to the party. The arrow is wrapped in a cloth that has been doused in oil and lit on fire. Does anyone wish to have the honour?", "-Ubo forwent the use of the bow and arrow and instead tried to use some good old fashioned fire magic to light the ship but he overshot by a great margin and just about almost incinerated Tim and his brand new cloak in the process. Were it not for the quick thinking of Lord Wah’ter and his ability to change the wind direction momentarily, we would have been having another funeral for a certain wizard", "-Lord Wah’ter did the honours and set the boat aflame. He didn’t have to fire the arrow however. Instead, he threw the bow AND the arrow at the boat that was well and truly in the distance at this point. Somehow, he succeeded.", "-A number of companions were also on the forecastle with the party. Yarrick was standing somberly while watching Jasin drift away in flames, Taylah stood with Toothless while shooting quick glances at Dig every now and then, Dustin remained stoic as ever. The pirates, including Isabella, Mina and Rozo, all paid respect to their fallen comrade.", "-A raven flew down to deliver a message to the Boys. This scroll detailed the updates on the campaign on land and troop movements. Apparently, some of the forces had already engaged with the demons closer to the Yarrum but on the brink of victory, reinforcements suddenly arrived in bulk from the enemy. How this was possible, the allies were still not sure but investigations were ongoing. ", "You suddenly hear worried chanting from the pirate crew; a certain unease begins to form on Mina’s face as she edges towards the bow of the ship. Her mouth is agape and she points to the distance where now you can see an eerie green fog begin to coalesce. Jasin’s boat, as it continues to burn, is engulfed in this ethereal haze. Then, you start to see shadows.", "Mina grips the handrails tightly. “This is impossible. This fog is unnatural.” She turns to Isabella. “Captain?”", "Isabella orders her men to mind the sails and to try and avoid the coming haze but it is far too late. She turns to you, Lord Wah’ter. “Prince of the Tritons, I recommend that you order your men on board.”", "Lord Wah’ter barks a few commands and the tritons quickly ascend the ship to await further instruction.", "Taylah Swiftwing points worriedly to the skies. “The Dragonfly cannot avoid it either.” ", "Your only choice now is to brave this situation…", "Tim makes circular motions with his hand and Elderwood staff. “If you can, get inside.” A dome composed of pure force is conjured at his location. Many rush into its sanctuary as they make contact with this green fog.", "The Fat Lady is the first to make contact as you sail through. You can barely see past your own hands and you can only wait to see what happens. The shadows begin to form around you and a tingle runs down your spine.", "Yarrick mutters under his breath. “By the gods…”", "You see that these shadows have taken the shapes of ships. All manners of them; small paddle boats to frigates and large, lumbering galleons like your own. But they are not whole. Aside from being composed of the very same green mist as this fog, these ships all show signs of great damage. Entire section of the hull missing, some with torn sails, others completely snapped in half. Finally, you see the spectral husk of Jasin’s boat now floating alongside the other phantom vessels.", "Dustin says grimly, “Only the kraken could do something like this. Boys, I hope you realise what you’re getting yourselves into.”", "Dig smirks. “Do we ever?”", "Dozens and dozens of ships sail past you like a never ending stream.", "Taylah grips her trident tightly. “But… if these are the shipsssss. Where are the crew?”", "Gizzard points to the waters. He readies his weapon.", "Looking down in the water, you come to the realisation that it has turned into a sea of red. A literal bloodbath and even more disturbing is the scores of dead men littering the surfaces of this crimson froth. Unlike the ghost ships, they are not spectres but real corpses. There are hundreds of faces all contorted in pain, their last moments of sheer terror captured in the stillness of death. But these dead are not limited to ONLY the crewmen of these lost ships. There are tritons and tortles floating amongst them.", "-Lord Wah’ter is warned by his men to not jump into the blood infested waters but the prince is desperate to save any potential survivors. Thankfully, there was one such survivor begging for help and is helped up by the triton prince onto the deck.", "-Just like the corpses floating on the water’s surface, this triton had many broken bones and lacerations that could only have come from a great beast. Lord Wah’ter beckoned for Ubo to get some food for the poor man and the tortle rushes below deck. In his desperation to save the triton, Lord Wah’ter failed to spot the gaping wound in the triton’s chest. A wound with three deep holes that could only come from tridents. The rest of the party definitely noted this and Gizzard confronted the Aquans about this. There was no doubt that these wounds were from the signature weapons of the House of Nekahd. Confused, Wah’ter asked the dying triton of what happened. He only got this in response:", "The eyes of this once proud triton warrior roll back and his mouth twists into one of pure agony as a litany of words stream out. “And that day will a monster be parted to dwell in the abyss of the ocean, the folds of his flesh are joined together, firm on him and immovable. The sword that reaches him cannot avail, nor the spear, the dart or the javelin.. One made without fear. Leviathan.”", "Then with a gasp of exasperation the triton lies truly dead once more. The haze immediately evaporates around you simultaneously and the entire armada is once again in the clear skies and sunny day, except the waters which are still polluted with the dead.", "-The party are met with only more questions. At least they were now out of this strange haze. Gizzard was extremely infuriated as these reminded him of his own people who were likely facing similar perils. He dreaded thinking that the Arafuarians were in this state as well. ", "-The tritons and tortles are all gathered by Lord Wah’ter and his small retinue of triton soldiers where they are burnt. Was this to cover up the wounds or simply an act of respect? Dustin, rather crudely, suggested that the dead tortles be put to good use for creating the resin needed to allow for underwater travel. Ubo heard this and was infuriated. The usual calm facade of the tortle was cracked and it seemed as if Ubo would strike the hogman. But instead, Ubo retreated to a dark corner of the ship and silently mulled over the dead. The pirates did commit to collecting tortle shells but made sure not to aggravate Ubo while doing so.", "-Yarrick blessed the spirits of the dead so that they could cross peacefully. Isabella then announced that they would arrive in Lantanis by night.", "~~~", "Yarrick’s Romantic Quest ", "-Night came and Yarrick approached the party to ask for advice on getting the attention of Mina, whom he had fallen for. Yarrick mentioned that they needed something light-hearted in light of recent traumas anyway and suggested that Tim use his telepathic communication magic to help him.", "-Tim refused because he believed that Yarrick should just be himself (basically the worst advice you can give someone). Lord Wah’ter was instead berating the party for allowing a child to approach a fully mature woman. Since none of the party told the triton any better, this remained unchecked and Yarrick was exposed to a stern lecturing from the prince.", "-Eventually Yarrick went into the map room where Mina was working on something. Minutes later he was kicked out with a bright red slap against his cheek. Apparently he was trying to show his ‘healing touch’ spell but fumbled and groped her accidentally. ", "-Tim went in to explain Yarrick’s actions to Mina but inadvertently caused Mina to take an interest in him instead. The wizard worked hard to become the halfling’s wingman but he knew deep down that this was a losing battle. Still, after speaking with Mina, Tim gave the halfling some encouraging talk and Dig offered to provide some Placebium drug for Yarrick. Yarrick took the drug and immediately felt more confident and handsome- the drug worked just as planned", "-Unfortunately, as Yarrick was working his own brand of magic with Mina, Lord Wah’ter stormed into the room and dragged Yarrick out by his arm. The triton then yelled at Mina for being a paedophile before slamming the door behind him. Yarrick passed out as a result of this entire kerfuffle. ", "~~~", "The Descent", "-Everyone went back to their original ships and Master Panvon created the resin which every ship is coated in. The party also coated themselves in this resin and it stinks really bad because of the fact that it was made of tortle shells. Ubo, with a deadpan face, jumped into the water after seeing this happen. Gizzard and Lord Wah’ter likewise dove into the depths. ", "Isabella announces. “Everyone, prepare to descend. Say farewell to the surface lads, it might be the last time we see it.”", "-Everyone came to the realisation that they had no way to propel the entire fleet downwards so they were stuck on the surface of the waters. Maybe they could have used magic? Maybe somehow use the reaction force from the manticore blast by the Dragonfly? No, Lord Wah’ter decided that he and his retinue of triton bodyguards would sink each of the ships slowly by stabbing the hulls of them to create holes. The sad thing? It worked.", "Almost like the sound of a vacuum, all the ships of the armada are essentially sucked underneath the surface of the Lantanic Ocean. The Fat Lady soon follows and you begin to plunge, to PLUMMET, faster than you could have possibly anticipated. Your ship zooms down into the depths of the water and it takes you all of your strength to steady yourself as you drop. You see schools of exotic fish, marine flora, sunken structures of some bygone age flicker past you and watch as the light of the moon quickly fades to nothing. Soon you are surrounded in darkness and even on the ship you can only barely make out the shapes of your party. At this water pressure you are grateful that you have the resin forming this translucent bubble around you or you would be crushed. You continue to drop for several minutes in this cover of blackness and the sound of water coursing past you reminds you that the other ships of the armada are also present.", "Finally after what seems like years, because in this blanket of darkness you have no sense of time you can see it. The fabled city of Lantanis that was once thought lost to all civilisation is now in sight in the distance. That’s right, you can see Lantanis in all of its glory and splendour because the light from this city is piercing through this thick, black veil like a sharp dagger. Such a luminous, radiant sight. It is unbelievable. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo can see the familiar Great Sea-shield which forms this sort of bubble around the entire city, like a dome which protects the Aquans from external dangers as well as provide clean oxygen for the people within. The architecture of this place is hundreds, maybe even thousands, of years ahead of even the most advanced megacities on Thera. From this distance you can’t make out too much of the details, but you can easily spot the white, pearly walls that circle the entirety of the city and the multitude of aqueducts stretching from one side to the other, water rolling off these archways so that it looks like the city is encased in a series of waterfalls. ", "Mina falls to her knees. “This is… heaven.”", "Isabella and Yarrick are speechless. ", "-The aquans were delighted to see Lantanis, their home after being separated from it for about a week. Tim and Dig were absolutely taken aback by this city which had no equal. (Ok so as a disclaimer I know I basically describe every city you guys go to as a city without equal but THIS time it’s extra true). Even Gizzard was impressed but more than anything this probably made him miss his own home even more.", "Isabella says aloud, “I can’t believe they’ve been hiding this jewel from the outside world for this long. We must get the Aquans to show us around when we get there.”", "Mina beams like a young kid. “So what is the delicacy there? Do they have festivals every day? What’s the latest fashion? Oh, oh! Is there a library?”", "Tim asks Barnabus, “Have we ever been to Lantanis before? You should have told us.”", "If Barnabus could shake his head, he would. “No, this is the first time in all cycles that we’ve ever gotten this far below the ocean. I’m just as much in the dark as you are. I mean I basically am always in a state of perpetual darkness when you close me up and put me in your satchel and-”", "You’re interrupted with the sound of wood cracking. Sharp, sudden impacts originating from the bottom of the ship’s hull. ", "Three sharp latching noises...", "-Humanoid creatures darted past the ship so fast that you’d only barely see them. These things were fast. Party, Mina and Yarrick are captured as they are bound in these bolas and shot with a syringe that knocks them out. The aquans are also captured and all are dragged off the ship and away from Lantanis into darkness as rest of crew yelled after them ", "~~~", "Tortured ", "You have to fight against the lethargy. It’s such a struggle to open your eyes that you feel a slight numbing pain in the back of your head. You try and piece together what has happened. You were on the Fat Lady and descending into Lantanis. Then… you jolt up as you remember the assault on your ship. Where are you? How long has it been since you were taken? Thankfully, the resin that you coated yourself in must still be working or you’d be long dead. ", "You can’t see anything. Are you blinded? Are you dead? No… relax. Breathe. Concentrate. There’s clearly a blindfold on your eyes and when you try move your wrists, they seem to be bound. You are also seated so you must be tied to a chair of some sort. The air is cold and stale here, like some refrigerated storeroom. Your throat is parched, your skin feels clammy and your ears are constantly hearing this high pitched buzz. ", "Then you hear a voice. “*coughing* Is anyone… there?” It’s Yarrick!", "You then hear Mina coughing. “Are you guys okay? Where are we?”", "A huge door creaks open and you hear the footsteps of two individuals step into this room. One of these figures walks past all of you and removes your blindfold so that you can see your surroundings. ", "One thing is for sure. You’re not in Lantanis.", "As expected, you are in a small, confined room with nothing except the chairs you are tied to and in front of you, a table containing all manners of tools and apparatus. The two individuals are clearly aquan. One of them is a sahuagin. Disgusting looking and smells even worse. One of his gills is oozing something green like mucous and it’s dripping onto the damp floor. The other is a smaller fish humanoid, it has scaly pink skin and its head is like that of a grouper and even less attractive because he has a distinct scar over one eye. Lord Wah’ter and Ubo recognise it immediately as a Kuo-toa, one of the most despised species of outcasts in the Deep Seas. They are talking to each other in Aquan so only Ubo and Lord Wah’ter can understand but even then you can guess what’s going to happen.", "The Kuo-toa inches its face close to each of you and its one good eye gazes at you in a mix of wonder and hatred. Then, in very atrocious common it garbles, “You enemies. Leviathan want information. Information. Give.” The kuo-toa points to one of the instruments on the table and the Sahuagin grabs it and delivers it to him. ", "Dig: What is their plan for fighting the kraken?", "-Large fingernail pliers and is threatening to rip off the claws from each finger. Two of his fingernails are plied off ", "-Dig doesn’t reveal anything. In fact he use a lightning breath which almost kills the sahuagin, prompting the torturers to bind his mouth", "Lord Wah’ter: Asks for location of the Apple of Eden", "-Iron to eyes but just before it reaches eyes he managed to struggle enough for them to fall out. Ubo then distracted the torturer, causing him to divert his attention", "Ubo: The hideout of the Tidefallen ", "-Ubo didn’t reveal anything about the Tidefallen (a band of corsairs led by one of the older brothers of the House of Nekadh) even when faced with the flask of acid that the torturer threatened him with", "-This acid was poured onto his shell, disfiguring it permanently and destroying a large portion of Ubo’s natural armour. Ubo wanted to scream in pain but managed to keep it to a bare minimum. The happy-go-lucky tortle was now beginning to show his other side, rage beginning to form in his heart.", "Gizzard: Give regards from Lizard Wizard and simply tortures him for the fun of it", "-Gizzard spit acid at both the torturers and was bound. They were quite afraid of him and didn’t bother to ask the lizardfolk much", "Tim", "-Didn’t end up being questioned because he managed to break through the magical bindings through sheer force of will; he is quite a powerful wizard to be able to do such a thing", "-Ended up fireballing both of them and watching in delight as they were turned to ashes. The goodness in this wizard must now be put into question for he has recently begun to revel in the destruction that he is capable of delivering upon his enemies.", "~~~", "The Rescue", "-Wall is blown apart by such force that you wouldn’t think you were underwater. A black cloak also covered in seaweed and sporting a sword. Tall and majestic but also quick on his feet, you can’t tell who or WHAT he is. Lord Wah’ter suspected that it was one of his brothers but his hand was swatted away. How dare the prince read the DM like a book!", "-The stranger threw a sack filled with the party’s belongings and says, “Follow me if you wish to live.” He then ran outside and the party found themselves in the belly of a beast. They were instructed to wait for five minutes but sensing that he wasn’t returning they decided to take matters into their own hands", "-It was actually Gizzard digging into the soft flesh of this creature which alarmed their captors. After dispatching them the party slowly made their way through the monster and dove through several sphincters and cavernous organs to make their way to a death knight that seemed to have recently knocked out their ‘saviour’", "-They dispatched the death knight with relative ease. They then needed to escape out of the mouth (they managed to open the mouth by destroying tumours or nodules in several sections of this beast). But unfortunately the mouth was closing and they all needed to get out of there before they became trapped ", "-Everyone would’ve been able to escape but the tortle, Ubo himself, tripped over and landed flat on his shell. Unable to get up, he also tripped up both Mina and Yarrick so that the three of them ended up sprawled on the ground as everyone ran past them out into the open waters. Tim used his quick thinking to blink in with ‘misty step’ and save them but having only a limited amount of time and two hands, he saved Yarrick and Ubo. He reached out to Mina but sensing futility he teleported out of there. ", "-There was no time, everyone had to leave now; it was every man for himself. But Dig wasn’t that sort of a person. Dig was a hero, perhaps the last true remaining hero in the party since most had become jaded. He polymorphed himself into a tiger (lmao underwater, just realised how stupid that is hahahahaha) and saved the stranger by throwing him out. However, as he reached down to save Mina and leap out of the beast with her in his jaws... the maw of this sea creature slammed shut. And the party, absolutely exhausted and drained from the encounter, could only watch helplessly as their leader and friend was dragged away into the dark depths of the ocean.", "-The mysterious stranger awoke from his unconsciousness and said he was sorry what happened to his friend but while looking at Wah’ter, he said. “It is good that you are safe at the very least… brother.", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

                    "Text": ["THE SALTFLATS", "Barnabus’ Gamble", "Your party are on their hands and knees, gasping for breath after having narrowly escaped the maws of this gargantuan beast. The creature swims away out of sight and with it, your companions Dig and Mina. There is scarce light here, in fact the sunlight could never hope to kiss the depths that you are at. Instead, bioluminescent plant life found on the sea floor and some angler fish give you brief glimpses into the abyss. It’s almost like you’re in the void because there is just vast expanses of nothingness here. You could almost drift away forever if you wanted… your trance is broken by the sound of Yarrick smashing some coral with his polearm.", "“Curses! This is all my fault! If I had only kept on my feet for a little while longer then… then…” he bows his head down in shame.", "The cloaked figure who has been silent this whole time, lifts back his hood to reveal his face. Your first thoughts are of how handsome he is, so much so that you can’t help but admire his chiselled jawline, prominent cheekbones and deep blue eyes. He has blue skin characteristic of a triton and his skin would be otherwise flawless were it not for some scars here and there. Judging from his physique, he seems to be a veteran of many battles, a warrior. And judging from the fact that he is still alive, he must be a damn good one at that. ", "He takes a few cautious steps towards your triton friend and mutters, “Wah’ter… is that you?”", "Wah’ters face lights up as he mutters the aquan word for brother. “Lok’tul...” ", "The triton embraces Wah’ter tightly. “Lok’tul.”", "“I can’t believe that it is really you, Bronyl.”", "“You best believe it, brother.” He steps back for a moment to have a good look at Wah’ter. “By the Drowned One you have matured into a fine young man. Last I heard you were training to become a Dragoon.” ", "Lord Wah’ter gloats, “You’ve heard right. I’ve become a full fledged member of the dragoon order now actually.”", "Bronyl laughs heartily. “Ah, the way you, me and Blaynth used to spar together you would have thought that one of us end up dead.” His attention switches to Ubo. “Ah and the tortle, I recognise you. Ubo was it? You were one of Master Oogway’s top pupils at the Fighter’s Academy if I recall correctly.”", "Ubo gives a brisk nod. ", "Bronyl takes a few steps back and now faces the remainder of the party. “I apologise for my rudeness. It has been a while since I’ve seen my kid brother and even longer I must admit, that I have had contact with the outside world. My name is Bronyl, first prince of Lantanis, eldest son of Poseidon of the House of Nekadh.” He bows.", "Gizzard grunts in acknowledgement and Tim slightly bows his head. ", "“Well met. Any friend of Wah’ter is a friend of mine. Now, I suppose I should fill you in on some things. We are not in Lantanis, which I am sure you have gathered by now. No, we are north of the great city at a place known as the Saltflats. There is naught here but plateaus of salt, frozen under layers of ice from ages long past. Nothing lives here except for mighty beasts of inordinate proportions. You will get the odd merchants of course for as the name Saltflats suggests, it is rich in sea salt and this commodity fetches quite a price at the markets. But now I must ask, why are you here? Not here- for I saw your entire fleet get attacked over the great city. I mean to ask, why did you travel to these depths?”", "Lord Wah’ter replies, “The surface dwellers have it just as bad as we do brother. Our worst fears have been confirmed. Demons have invaded this world from the other planes and have started to attack the land. Our great enemy that we have been fighting is one of these demons and goes by the moniker of the kraken.”", "“Truly? Then it is worse than I thought.” Bronyl doesn’t betray his emotions here but Wah’ter knows that his brother is worried. “You see... I have not been home for three years since me and the Tidefallen, that is, my band of corsairs, travelled towards the Darkest Reaches to battle against the nation’s threats. This kraken that you speak of sounds remarkably similar to one that my people call the Dark Beast. Brother, has the Dark Beast attacked?”", "“You did not hear, Lok’tul? We defended against it recently as it neared the city. Had we not stopped it, then beautiful Lantanis would have been leveled.”", "Ubo interjects, “Not the kraken... one of its tentacles apparently.”", "Bronyl’s face turns serious and he grits his teeth. “I have been gone for much too long. Even in the Darkest Reaches the number of dissidents and corrupted seafolk has risen exponentially in the last couple of years. Perhaps these two events are linked. In any case, we must travel to Lantanis post-haste.” ", "The party are in general agreement. But there is a small matter that is still hanging in the air.", "Yarrick says, “B-but what about Dig and Mina?”", "Bronyl frowns. “Even the fastest seafolk would be unable to catch up to such a creature. I truly lament your loss. They seemed like good people but alas we do not have the luxury of time.”", "The Halfling pleads to the party. “Please, isn’t there something we can do? You’re not going to let Mina die are you? Or Dig? He’s the leader, right? Tim?”", "Tim feels Barnabus once again struggling against his clasps. ", "Bronyl instinctively reaches for his sword when Barnabus begins to blabber. It must be a sight to see a magical tome begin to speak in Common.", "He sputters, “Cheer up everyone! Once again I, the great Barnabus has a genius idea to save the day. Or is it night? I can’t really tell it all seems like a blur not that I would even know what a blur is because I see quite clearly. In fact, I would say that I have 20/20 vision and that’s not even hindsight. Wait, what was I… oh yes, my idea. So Tim and I have been working on a pocket plane, haven’t we my friend?”", "The wizard realises what the celestial arm is about to propose. It is ingenious, albeit potentially catastrophic if they fail.", "“Okay, okay, bear with me. Now, a pocket plane is something that emits magical energy like no other, it sends shockwaves throughout the aether. Now if, and I’m saying IF, we could tap into this pocket plane and create this signal if you will and someone magically gifted like Dig was able to latch onto it then perhaps…” Barnabus pauses for a bit. “But of course, there may be a few complications.”", "Wah’ter states, “The rest of us aren’t so magically inclined, book. So please spell (pun intended hehe) it out for us.”", "Gizzard grunts.", "Ubo isn’t too convinced. “You say complications. Such as?”", "Barnabus says, “Well first off. Tim and I haven’t had time to perfect the perfect energy input and the magical harmonic frequencies required for a smooth transitional state and stabilisation fields, meaning that… well, meaning that we haven’t worked it out quite yet.”", "Yarrick frowns. “So we can’t do it then?”", "“No, no I didn’t say that. I’m saying that because we haven’t yet perfected travel within the plane, if we decided to have Dig and Mina travel through it there is a small chance that they might… lose their memories upon their return. But it’s a SMALL chance, within known parameters, it would be a very calculated risk.”", "Bronyl interjects. “By the looks of it, it seems you have three options. One is to follow this book’s gamble and risk amnesia for your companions. Two, we wait a few days for my Tidefallen who are currently in the Darkest Reaches to attempt a rescue at which point it will be truly up to the gods whether they succeed or not. Or your third option, and I hate to say this, is to cut your losses.” ", "-Was it ever in question? The party decided that they would risk the side effects for a shot at bringing Dig back. Of course, there was the chance that their friend would come back catatonic or something but there was simply no time for them to spare going on a dragonborn hunt while the fate of the world was at stake. Also do you know how much extra work that would be for the DM like fuk m8...", "The Transportation Ritual ", "-Bronyl called for his sea horse, which was essentially a half-horse half-fish type deal, and went out to find a merchant or some transport for the party. He wished the party luck in the ritual.", "-Barnabus explained the ritual to the party and outlined the importance that every step be done perfectly. He had Tim chant through some incantations and words of magic while the rest of the party got to work. Keep in mind that for every step of the ritual that was not performed to the letter, the risk of complications increased. ", "-First step was the construction of the teleportation circle; they had to make a perfect circle which actually was a tough feat. Making a circle which is ‘perfect’ is basically impossible using human judgement. That being said, none of them came remotely close to constructing a circle so the teleportation ‘circle’ was more akin to that of a rectangle. This was their first mistake.", "-The second step involved the party members getting into a dance. Wah’ter immediately knew something was up and chose not to get involved but Gizzard and Ubo danced with reckless abandon. When Barnabus was confronted by the triton prince on the significance of this step, the babbling book simply laughed. ", "-A line was then given to them by Barnabus, ancient words from another plane. The accuracy of their chants would be paramount to the success of this spell.", "a. Gizzard: “Mansueti sunt spiritus vacui atque stabiliunt”: Gizzard was the most eloquent of all three. This came as a surprise to the party who were now familiar with Gizzard’s poor grasp of Common. Yet the lizard man seemed strangely fluent in this otherwordly language ", "b. Ubo: “Sine laesione planum ineamus, nunc autem requiem”: This was a tragedy to be sure. ", "c. Wah’ter: “Tutum iter planum transire conaretur omnibus”: Wah’ter wasn’t too bad here. In his royal education he had dabbled in other lost languages as a past time and this particular phrase wasn’t too hard on the aquan tongue. ", "-The result of the ritual; before Dig or Mina could even be seen there was a flash of light and darkness began to envelop the party. Shadows from other realms, some ghostly apparitions of some manner, appeared to attack the party. The missteps in the ritual must have summoned these damned creatures. They were eventually dispatched- mainly by Wah’ter since the creatures seemed resistant to nonmagical weaponry. ", "-Dig and Mina soon followed but it was soon apparent that Mina had suffered from extreme memory loss; not even remembering her own name. Tim collapsed from exhaustion after the spell while the party bickered with each other. Dig Bickman commented that he had not experienced such a headache since explaining democracy to Gizzard. ", "-Wah’ter was insensitive and joked that they should make Mina, who was now an amnesiac, into a backpack. This enraged Yarrick a great deal and by great deal I mean as in the halfling took his pike and charged at Wah’ter. Wah’ter, thinking that Yarrick was simply a small child, did not expect the halfling to cast a necrotic touch onto him. It was as if the paladin’s hand squeezed against his heart, sending a bone chilling cold throughout his whole being. The triton dropped his trident and went to subdue Yarrick, just to stop the conflict. The both of them continued to struggle against each other as Ubo and Gizzard watched on, unsure of how to intervene or even if they should intervene. Mina on the other hand had already retreated behind a rock, cowering and quivering from this strange scene that she had awoken to", "-Dig Bickman, seeing this all unfold before him was not only disappointed, but pissed off that their party was falling apart from this. He inhaled as deeply as he could even though the resin was barely protecting his lungs from the water that was surrounding them all and he roared. This roar immediately caused everyone to cower back in fear. None of them expected the fury that was Dig Bickman. All fighting stopped and they all turned their attention to the party leader, who had no kind words for them. He berated them for being children and told them that they had bigger concerns. Yarrick reluctantly backed away from Wah’ter as a result and returned to tend to Mina but Mina had already collapsed at this point.", "-A few more silent moments passed as the party collected their thoughts and Tim slowly regained his consciousness", "The Journey Back ", "-Bronyl came back with a Zoran merchant (picture the fish-like people from Legend of Zelda) named Angel who had several sea horses available for everyone. Bronyl properly introduced himself to Dig and commended him for his bravery and heroics. ", "-Just to put in a disclaimer here, Ubo DOESN’T like Angel, which is a damn shame.", "-Everyone got on their own sea horses while Yarrick and Mina rode together. Taming the sea horses was not all that challenging as the party seemed to have a natural touch with animals. Ubo and Wah’ter didn’t even need to try, considering that they were natives of this place. ", "-They set off back towards Lantanis while travelling through these Saltflats. The Saltflats were essentially just endless dunes and plains of salt. The salt would be trapped under ice (ask Boyd for more information on how the physics works here because we all had a discussion on if this was even remotely possible in real life) and preserved by all the water pressure. There was little sea life to be found and even less light but they followed Bronyl and Bronyl seemed to know where he was going", "-As they rode on their sea horses, Bronyl went and had small talks with the party members individually, getting to know them a little better. He did tell them all that they would make Lantanis by tomorrow so they would need to find somewhere suitable to camp for the night in case of the dangerous creatures said to lurk in these waters.", "-So with Dig, Bronyl started with: “There are times when a man must choose between what is right and what is easy. You are a hero, sir. And you have my respect.” Dig took the compliment kindly. Bronyl was the leader of the band of corsairs known as the Tidefallen and this allowed him to empathise with Dig on being responsible for a large group of people. Bronyl also commented that although the tritons didn’t revere dragons as the surface does, he noted many similarities within their cultures. He even mentioned that there was a theory that the tritons were once distant cousins to the dragonborn. ", "-Bronyl remarked to Gizzard that he looked like a mighty warrior. Gizzard nodded and recognised the strength in this triton prince as well. Bronyl suggested that they spar in the future for fun so that he could gauge the strength of someone from the Arafuara swamps. Bronyl actually had no idea what a swamp even was so when Gizzard told him about his home, he seemed genuinely interested. Gizzard then went on to explain the plight that he and his people were experiencing. Bronyl pledged his assistance after the kraken was dealt with and Gizzard was elated. The lizardman told Bronyl that he had a strong heart, which was probably the nicest thing Gizzard had ever said to anyone.", "-Bronyl asked Ubo about how his master was doing and whether he was still on the path of being an elemental warrior. Ubo didn’t feel like talking much on the matter so Bronyl changed the subject to his cooking because after all, Ubo’s restaurant was quite well known around Lantanis. Ubo’s face lit up as he talked about his restaurant and the dishes that he had experienced while on the surface- which had given him inspiration. The last thing Bronyl noticed was the acid induced wound on Ubo’s shell. He suggested to Ubo that he visit the Deepsmith in Lantanis in order to get it repaired. Ubo remembered the sea serpent scale that he acquired from the battle a few days prior and wondered whether it would make a great material to replace some of the shell that he had lost.", "-Bronyl talked to Tim about his experiences with a human that he once called a friend. The sword that Bronyl used actually belonged to this human and although the trident was a favoured weapon of the aquans, he preferred to use the blade in honour of this man who taught him so much about the surface world. Like an excited child, Bronyl asked Tim whether there really were seas of fire and entire lands of just sand to which Tim simply smiled and responded with “Yes.” Bronyl and Tim also engaged in boring talks of the politics of the surface world.", "-The last person Bronyl would talk with was Wah’ter. There was a lot of ground to cover so Bronyl started with asking his brother how his time in the dragoons was and about the battle against the kraken. He then asked Wah’ter about his time on the surface and his thoughts on the people there. Wah’ter didn’t lie, he wasn’t really impressed with what he saw there. The triton dragoon told Bronyl that not only were the people savages, they were technologically inferior and their cities were nothing compared to glorious Lantanis. Bronyl laughed, hardly surprised that his brother would say such a thing. ", "-Something intrigued Bronyl about Wah’ter though. It was his helmet. Even though they had not seen each other for years, Wah’ter still kept his helmet on. Why? Bronyl reached towards the helmet and Wah’ter did not stop him as he lifted the helmet off slightly to peer at his brother’s face. The rest of the party could not see this, but Bronyl’s face turned serious as he asked Wah’ter: “When are you going to tell your companions? You can’t hide it forever, you know. They deserve that at the very least.” Wah’ter put his helmet back on and rode forwards in silence. ", "Camping for the night", "-Eventually Bronyl found a suitable place to camp. Angel went to tend to the sea horses before going to sleep but not before shooting odd glances every now and then towards our favourite tortle friend, Ubo. ", "-Bronyl and Ubo helped to make a sea glass tent which essentially formed a bubble around the party.", "-Mina at this point was still unconscious and Yarrick was seething with anger at recent events. Ubo spotted a field of seaweed out in the distance and decided to do something about the current situation. Thankfully there were no great creatures of the sea to gobble the tortle up whole as he returned with a handful of seaweed (and some nasty stings from other poisonous flora present) which he cooked for Yarrick. The halfling was immediately visibly relaxed upon eating one of these edibles that the tortle cooked for him. This would pacify him for the moment being", "-As Bronyl and Wah’ter continued to reminisce deep into the night, the party drifted off into a peaceful sleep", "The Royal Entourage ", "The journey was shorter than expected, well at least you think so because your biological clock is suffering at these depths. You realise that you took the sun for granted. Still, now that you’re approaching the jewel of the seas, Lantanis, you can start to see the lights once again. ", "Even though you’ve seen it before you’re still taken away by this megacity. The pearly white walls look smooth and have this illustrious sheen like polished marble. A perfectly shaped glass dome called the Great Sea-shield forms a dome over the entire city like a snow globe while a series of aqueducts stretch from one end of the city to the other forming a cascade of waterfalls. ", "Looking to the sea bed you see a pathway leading to the front gate of the city. A sign tells you that you are approaching the Neptulon Gate. The Zora merchant, Angel, that has accompanied you thus far takes her leave and returns towards the Saltflats. Your party however, can spot several figures at the front of the city’s gates. ", "Bronyl whispers to you all. “It seems that the entire royal family has come out to say hi. Dust yourselves off and bow, first impressions and all that.” He gives a little wink as you all ride towards the welcoming party.", "There are ten people here standing outside the gates who are unmistakeably from the royal family in Lantanis. There are also scores of triton royal guards standing around, some atop the walls of the city and others surrounding the members of the House of Nekadh. The tallest among the ten is well built, pale blue skin, and sports long grey hair and a beard to match. He wears a jewelled crown that shimmers electric blue. Wah’ter and Ubo know who this is immediately but the rest of your party have little doubt as to the identity of this man. This must be the king. ", "The king stands proudly and announces to you all. “The House of Nekadh welcomes you to Lantanis, my friends. I am the King of the Tritons, the head of the House of Nekadh, Poseidon.” He bows his head slightly to you all. ", "The aquans bow and so do the rest of the party after some urging from Wah’ter.", "Yarrick introduces himself too. When Mina doesn’t respond, Yarrick apologises. “Sorry, great king of the seas, our friend here has suffered from traumatic memory loss, she means no offence.”", "Poseidon smiles warmly. “Please just call me Poseidon, no need for formalities. The only difference between us is a crown, none of us are gods. It is a pleasure to meet outsiders after all this time. Our scouts reported that your ships were attacked on their way towards our city. I apologise on behalf of Lantanis, it is a stain on our honour as hosts for not providing adequate protection.” He shoots a quick glance at Wah’ter. “Indeed, had we KNOWN that we would be having guests then perhaps we could have planned appropriately for such an encounter?”", "Wah’ter turns a slight shade of red. “Father... I-”", "Bronyl rests an arm around Wah’ter’s shoulder. “Come now, father. My brother must have had his hands full up on the surface. I hear they’ve felled many great foes in their adventures.”", "The king relents. “Hmph. Well, rest assured my friends, your allies are safe and in great health within the Surface Embassy. Now, I will remark that I have an idea of why you are here and why many have ventured to these depths. I surmise that my son here, Wah’ter, has asked for assistance against the Dark Beast. Would I be correct in this assumption?”", "The party confirm this.", "“In that case you are even more than welcome here. Dark days are upon us all it seems, not just for my people. I gladly welcome whatever alliance my son has helped to forge in the overworld. For now, however, I must apologise. It has been some time since I’ve laid eyes on my eldest son and I’d like to have a walk with him.”", "Bronyl nods. “As you wish, father.”", "Poseidon gestures to the rest of the people gathered here. “I’m sure that you are all weary from your travels. We shall meet again tonight in the Royal Garden at the Oceanus district. I can properly introduce you to the rest of the family then and we can talk about this nasty business with the end of the world and all of that. For now, Wah’ter can show you all around the city-he is always talking about Lantanis after all. Will you do this for me, son?”", "“Of course, father,” Wah’ter replies.", "“Good, good. Ah, master Ubo you are here too, perhaps you can honour me with some of your famed cooking later tonight.”", "Ubo smiles and bows to his king.", "“Mm. Now one last thing before I leave you to your leisure. I must tell you to be mindful of our laws and customs. Most of it is the same as your world, do not steal or kill or harm another being. But even more importantly,” Poseidon’s face turns serious, he looks quite formidable in fact, “do not question the rule of the House of Nekadh. Doing so shall result in harsh penalties such as exile or… beheading. Are we clear?”", "Dig mutters, “Like a dictatorship, don't you think?” Thankfully, no one hears this but the party who silently concur.", "Poseidon smiles warmly again at the flick of a switch. He nods and takes his leave. The majority of the guards and the royal family take their leave as well.", "Once they have gone, Yarrick takes Mina’s hand in his and says to you. “I’m going to go to the Surface Embassy and meet with the rest of our companions. I think… I think Isabella is going to want to know what’s happened to… well, what’s happened.” ", "Tim sighs. “I’m going to follow him. I feel slightly responsible for what’s happened to Mina, even if it wasn’t really my fault.” He shoots a look at the three party members who absolutely butchered the ritual. ", "And with that, the party is free to explore the great city of Lantanis.", "~~~", "LANTANIS", "Entering the Depths District", "Inside the glass sea-shield it is just normal oxygen, like you were in a normal city but outside you can see that there are no skies, only water surrounding you, in some ways it would be suffocating but you are distracted by the beauty of the city to pay any heed to such dangers.", "-There were all manners of people here including Zorans, tritons, mermaids, mermen, tortles, sea slugs that were essentially public transport creatures. Not to mention that there were now several gymnasian (tabaxi, lionfolk, ratfolk, hogmen, and a lot of other beastkin), pirates and other humans from the allied fleet. It seemed that the city was abuzz with all the visitors that were here in the city and trade was booming as every aquan wanted a piece of the foreign pie. Although the party did not understand the value of gold (their currency was in Shells), they recognised the surface goods as a worthwhile investment for the future.", "-The streets were like a cobblestone type aesthetic with sea flora here and there like anemone and whatnot. Aqueducts stretched above them while the buildings themselves seemed pretty much like futuristic huts. This was a utopian city and although they were not even in the richer side of Lantanis, it was obvious that nothing rivalled it back on the surface. ", "-Everyone that saw Wah’ter and the party bowed in respect as they recognised this son of the House of Nekadh. No one would dare disrespect them but this didn’t stop them from gawking at the peculiar dragonborn, the imposing lizardman and the mysterious, robed human. Every now and then they would step on some slime from all the sea slugs slithering everywhere with many aquans seated atop its gelatinous body.", "*Note, the next parts of the tour are not in order*", "Mage Tower ", "-The mage tower was imposing and looked like a great spire that reached high up into the sea dome. It paled slightly in comparison to the Academy Tower in Windar but not by much. Inside, they found themselves looking at a chamber of sorts where a glowing stone or gem was pulsating. Wah’ter and Ubo knew what it was; the fabled Apple of Eden which was essentially the counterpart to the Philosopher’s stone. Even though the party didn’t know of its name, they knew that they were looking at a powerful source of magic.", "-They met inside the head triton mage of this tower who went by the name of Horatio the Second of Oxium. He preferred to go by the name of H2O. He was a haughty individual and barely paid any respect to Lord Wah’ter despite him being a member of the royal family. It seemed that because H2O was in charge of protecting what was perhaps the most prized possession in all of Lantanis, there wasn’t much that the mage was afraid of in terms of punishment. Wah’ter wasn’t too big of a fan of this mage. H2O looked to the rest of the party. ", "H20 regards the party for a moment before saying, “Magic is like water, my friends. It takes on the shape of its vessel, which is why us aquans are naturally gifted with magic in its most primal state. Now, all of you here possess some latent magical abilities but there is one amongst you that I can sense incredible aptitude for the arcane arts. I’d like to teach you a few things and maybe show you around a bit more, if you will allow me.” He points to Dig. “Now, the first spell I will teach you will allow you to breathe underwater like second nature. Very useful considering you are staying at these depths. By the end of my lesson you will be able to cast this spell without even thinking about it.” ", "-Horatio taught Dig three spells: ‘Heart of Water’ which allowed for effortless water breathing, ‘Pressure Sphere’ which was essentially trapping humanoids in a sphere of... pressure, and ‘Drown’ which I’ll let you work out for yourselves.", "Fighters Academy", "-The Fighter’s Academy was exactly as you’d imagine it; large training yards and drilling squares where the entirety of Lantanis forces would go for martial training. The academy was divided into four sections; those being the Dragoon division, Wavekept division (street police), Sethon division (the main army including conscripts), and elemental school", "-At the dragoon division was an instructor named General Hydro. He was referred to as Gen Hydro for short. The man seemed to have been close with Lord Wah’ter and even asked Wah’ter to show him what he had learnt for old time’s sake. All around the party were aquans leaping into the air with extraordinary grace and plummeting down with deadly precision. When Wah’ter went to demonstrate his dragoon manoeuvres however, Gen Hydro noticed that the prince was fighting wildly, like an angry bull. The movements and actions that Wah’ter were fighting with were erratic and very unlike the controlled style of the dragoon fighters. However, Wah’ter simply chalked it to being tired and out of practice since he had not been at the fighter’s academy for so long. Gen Hydro took this as an opportunity to further develop Wah’ters skills. ", "-They then visited the Elemental School where Ubo was struck in the head with a shoe flying out from the sliding doors. As Ubo lay on the ground massaging his forehead, five cute little tortle children wearing different coloured headbands came to hug Ubo. These five children were Franklin, Koopa, Crush, Squirt, and Mock. ", "-The elemental master named Master Oogway looked like a very, very old tortle. He walked out with his walking stick and despite his old age, whooped Ubo into oblivion as he yelled at his ex-student for being so lazy. You see, Ubo was once an avid learner of the elemental arts but soon found out this passion was in cooking and so gave up while on the path of the elemental warrior to pursue this dream. Master Oogway never forgave this transgression and made sure that Ubo knew of his disappointment. The master began to recount the story of the tortle and the hare, saying that Ubo needed to have more patience and stick to the path. However, Master Oogway would eventually admit to missing him and instead offered to teach him a few more things about harnessing Ubo’s inner rage and turmoil. Get ready for a class change boys... ", "-Funnily, the baby tortles here at the elemental school were only here by accident since their parents mistook the elemental school as elementary school.", "The Shellebrity Chef ", "-Ubo’s famous restaurant was named the Shellebrity Chef and everyone in Lantanis knew about it. There were lines and lines of aquans waiting outside the restaurant just to sample some of the famed cuisines available in the restaurant. The restaurant itself was shaped in the form of a turtle. The entrances were present where the openings for a turtle’s legs, tail and head would be while the shell itself was made with the remains of dead tortles. Just kidding, but that would be pretty hilarious lol", "-Anyway, Ubo went inside his restaurant to find it fully packed. Greeting him were his old classmates from the elemental school (also another reason Master Oogway was pissed- because he had taken four of his students with him on this crazy restaurant venture). Their names were Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo. They all rocked a different colour headband reminiscent of the elemental they dedicated the most time to during their training at the fighter’s academy. ", "-Donatello had been appointed the head cook by Ubo but he was quickly proving to be a disappointment. See, there was a massive problem that the restaurant was currently facing. The problem was that they had completely run out of stock. As in, there was absolutely no ingredients, spices or anything to be found in the kitchen. When Donatello was confronted by an enraged Ubo on why he had poorly handled the goods of the restaurant, Donatello admitted that he had had no money left to get stock because he was using his wages to do so. Ubo was flabbergasted. How could someone be so stupid to use his own salary to pay for inventory? Did Donatello have no grasp of general business practice or finance? Common sense? Ubo was close to exploding and would have probably killed someone were it not for his friend Wah’ter calming him down. It also didn’t help that the party were mostly in hysterics for how poorly managed this restaurant was. Long story short, Ubo fired Donatello and appointed another one of the tortles as the head chef.", "-His choice was of course Michaelanagelo, the most irresponsible of the bunch. The famous beverage known as sea wine was found to be in fact fermented tortle piss, which Mikey was largely responsible for creating. The taste of the drink would therefore depend on Mikey’s diet and the availability of the drink would depend on his own hydration. In any case, Ubo took it upon himself to spoil his party members with some of his own famed cooking. Thankfully, he had some of the sea serpent meat that he had gotten prior, which he used to great effect. ", "-Actually, he didn’t really cook that well at all. He cooked an appetiser of prawn cocktails but somehow managed to screw it up by mixing sugar with salt. Sweat now pouring profusely down his head he tried to make it up with the main course; a simple seared sea serpent steak. However, the stress also got to him and he burnt most of the steaks while dropping others onto the floor of the restaurant. Were it not for the fact that the desert he conjured up afterwards was absolutely divine, the party would have roasted him for years to come", "-Leonardo and Raphael argued with their friend Ubo on rehiring Donatello and telling Ubo that they would do better next time. Ubo, being soft hearted as he was, decided to give Donatello another chance; but not before giving Donatello a stern talking to. ", "Barracks", "-There are barracks situated within the walls themselves; nothing too remarkable, it was where the wavekept and the sethon are housed and given regular salary", "-Wah’ter did introduce the rest of the party to the soldiers here and they were well received by everyone. Dig made himself known to the Sethon and the Wavekept. They seemed to respect Dig’s authority and power for the time being, although this could have been due to the fact that one of the princes of Lantanis commanded them to behave themselves. Only time will tell.", "-There were also sea stables close to each of the barracks where sea horses would be housed, ready for deployment when needed", "Residential ", "-The appearance of the houses depended on the species living there and most of the residential areas varied in terms of lavishness based on the level of wealth of the zone. That being said, the general architecture of the buildings here in Lantanis were years ahead of anything on Australis, Gymnasia or even Europa. ", "Markets ", "-The markets were bustling with people of all races and ages. There were many wares being sold and considering the large influx of foreigners, there was now pandemonium in the aquan economy. There were the usual things being sold, such as arms and armour, snacks (weird exotic snacks and fruits), fish market, medicinal seaweed, scale salon (trimming scales instead of nails) ", "-An old grey haired triton, blind by the looks of it, latched onto the wrist of Lord Wah’ter as he walked by with the party and gave him a foreboding message:", "“Once the true one reveals himself, the false one shall bring a country’s doom and a rise of a new god. Once the seas turn to ice, a broken promise shall usher forth the dawn of darkness. It shall be on that day that the day is shortest, and fate will be decided between Abel and Cain.” ", "-This message had little meaning for the party for the time being, especially considering that Abel and Cain was something that the people of Thera would have no idea about. But what did all of this mean? ", "The Surface Embassy", "-The embassy from the inside and outside looked like it had been used very little. The building itself was made completely from materials found from the surface such as wood from ship wrecks and goods lost at sea. As a result, the surface embassy resembled an amalgamation of relics from different cultures and times of the surface world. It was slightly creepy but also strangely appealing. It was definitely something that the party had never seen before.", "-Inside, they found the companions that they travelled with during their voyage under the sea. There were also a bunch of pirates, gymnasians, and imperial soldiers walking around, some in rooms scattered through", "-Dustin Hoggman greeted the party while reading some parchment, making a comment that Ancient Common was hard to read. He remarked that Lantanis was a beautiful place ripe for the picking, a treasure hunter’s heaven (Ubo and Wah’ter pretended not to hear this). Dustin then surprised Wah’ter and Ubo by asking about the Vault of the Tritons. When the both of them declined answering his query, he smiled and said that it confirmed his suspicions of a celestial arm being there. He promised to head out the next day to investigate.", "-Taylah Swiftwing greeted the party and was visibly elated when Dig was present. She went in for a hug but remembered herself and opted to shake his hand instead. Dig likewise followed suit. He didn’t want to make things any more awkward for the poor, sheltered admiral. Fus and Ro were also there and they acknowledged the dragonborn’s presence. She remarked that the aqueducts were a brilliant idea and that she would propose the idea to the Emperor after this was all done. Meanwhile, Toothless was busy gobbling up fish as the party stood around. It turned out that the Dragonfly was still safe and sound but that the Philosopher’s Stone was reacting very strangely to something within the city.", "-Master Panvon was still in chains and Unit A.B. is next to him, expressionless. Master Panvon rolled his eyes as the party approached. Unit A.B. greeted the party and updated them that Master Panvon had built the soul delimiter, or the soul phase limiter or something. She also told Wah’ter that she finds the city beautiful and was surprised that the world was so vast. She expressed that she wanted to travel the world one day. Master Panvon opened his mouth to protest using the soul phase limiter but was quickly silenced by Wah’ter, who ordered some Wavekept to bring the halfling to the Dungeons of Coral. The party debated themselves for a little while longer on what to do with the warforged before deciding to leave her in peace for the time being. She wasn’t causing any trouble as she was and there were more important things to consider- such as their meeting with the king later that night and of course the kraken threat looming just over the horizon.", "-When approaching Isabella, Rozo, Mina and Yarrick (and Tim), they were quite hesitant. Mina wasn’t speaking much and was generally confused but she seemed quite interested in Yarrick. Yarrick was talking to her very softly and gently like one would with a child, and Mina found herself being drawn to the kind gentlemen. Rozo didn’t say much either but told Gizzard that he wasn’t surprised a great warrior like him got out unscathed after the attack. ", "-Isabella expressed that Mina had lost all of her memory and had only just recovered her own name. She lamented that Mina’s dreams of travelling all over the world was now shattered. All of the things that Mina had seen and recorded were now lost to her... truly tragic. However, the party were already jaded at this point and had been desensitised from all the things they had witnessed. Mina was just another unfortunate soul who had to suffer in this great crusade. Isabella asked Tim if there really was no other way but the pocket plane. It was obvious that Isabella wanted to blame Tim for what had happened, but knew that it would have been unfair to do so. Sadly, as the party went to leave the embassy, they noticed Mina pointing to a map on the wall. The map made her smile but when Yarrick asked her why she was smiling, she said that she had no idea. Isabella cried to herself silently as she watched this shell of her friend stand there before her. ", "Red Light district ", "-They didn’t visit this area but I will say that this place really DOES smell like fish hehe xd", "Deepsmith", "-The famed deepsmithy was owned by a sea giant by the name of Lachlan Ness, one of the last remaining members of his kind. Only Gizzard visited the giant however, and so the conversation between them both was very short. Lach Ness wasn’t too good with words and Gizzard wasn’t that great with common so you can imagine how that turned out. Still, Gizzard wanted a better weapon and so offered the deepsmith the sea serpent tooth. Unfortunately, Lach tossed Gizzard’s current weapon out the window, literally. Gizzard never found it. But at least he was going to get a better hammer now...", "AUDIENCE WITH THE KING", "-Everyone is here, King greets the party again and remarks that he likes to have meetings in the royal gardens instead of the throne room because it helps him to think clearer", "-Introduce each family member: Poseidon, Baynth, Gray Lekh, Belthyn, (Sturn the Quick is not present here, he is more of a robin hood type character and doesn’t associate himself with the royal family), Lug (Sturn’s wife), Aryn the Myst, Wolyn and of course Bronyl ", "-King asks them to give a rundown of what is happening on the surface and how this links to the Kraken", ">asks them what their plan is to dispose of the kraken", ">and asks them of what they want the people of Lantanis to do after", ">does promise to pledge his aid once the kraken is dealt with", ">however, he remarks that they do not have enough information yet; this triggers him to ask Bronyl", "-King orders Bronyl to report to him everything he’s learnt at the darkest reaches", ">Bronyl reports increased numbers of corrupted sea creatures during the three years he was away", ">They all refused to talk even after interrogation but there was a common prayer that they all chanted before they were executed: “Glory to the Dark beast”", ">therefore, the next lead is to investigate the temple of the Dark beast, but since only acolytes and worshippers are allowed inside they have to infiltrate it (King being cheeky) ", "-The king mentions one last thing: he sent an expedition recently to fight against a large incursion of corrupted seafolk but they haven’t returned; asks party if they’ve seen them", ">when mention of the trident wounds, this causes a stir amongst everyone", ">Bronyl/Wah’ter mentions the name of Sonyt and the king immediately is enraged, calling him a traitor and that he was exiled and that he will destroy that good for nothing son.

He must have ran up here as soon as he heard the roars, only to find this scene of slaughter. ", "Your party stand on the opposite end of the hallway to this creature… this abomination. ", "The beast looks draconic in nature; long, dangling claws sharper than any manmade blade you’ve ever seen, sapphire-blue scales encasing its entire body like some impenetrable suit of plate, his limbs bulging with explosive strength from its taut, musclebound frame. From the maw of the beast you see razors for teeth and saliva dripping from its jaws as it scans the room with its blood-red eyes.", "Then beside you, Bronyl mutters, “Brother, what have you done?”", "Did you hear him right? Brother? You’re not stupid. You can see Lord Wah’ters helmet beside the beast’s leg, you can see the prince’s iconic trident behind him and the blood trail leading from your triton companion’s room. But you dare not think it to be true…", "-Party are more than aware of who is standing in the hallway before them. There are some concerns amongst the party of whether Ubo and Bronyl knew of Wah’ters transformation beforehand. Were they being betrayed right now?", "Bronyl curses. “Lock the doors behind us! We need to stop him right here and right now. He is stronger than you and I. We must work together and take him down. Dead or alive.” He draws his sword and takes a slow step forward. “I’m sorry it had to be this way… brother.”", "The creature roars and bounds towards you with great strides, tearing up the carpet with its claws as it races down the hallway on all fours.", "-Battle ensues in the hallway as the doors are shut and the party are fighting the Abomination. Tim is knocked to the ground and eventually taken out after being battered by the creature. Dig transforms himself and Ubo using polymorphy into giant apes as they battle Wah’ter", "-Wah’ter continues to leap into the air and use his dragoon powers to overwhelm the party while Bronyl runs from room to room trying to cut any escapes. However, Lord Wah’ter smashes open a window and leaps out, causing mayhem amongst the party ", "FINAL DECISION- OK SO LET’S MAKE IT THAT THE CITY OF LANTANIS IS IN WATER which can be breathed normally by aquans able to breathe underwater, but there is magic in this water (supplied by the Apple of Eden within the magic tower) that can allow terrestials and other creatures the ability to breathe it as normal air. There is no water resistance when walking as normal and gravity is also as normal in terms of descent. However, when a creature wishes to swim upwards, magic in the water ‘changes’ so that the creature swims instead of jumps... lmfao", "-Anyway, Bronyl tries to talk sense into his brother the whole time with every swing but to no avail. The party watch as Lord Wah’ter first throws Gizzard out of the window onto the floors of the oceanus district before leaping out himself and heading straight for the city. Were it not for Gizzard wilfully trying to swim upwards during his descent, the fall would have most certainly killed him", "-The party begin their pursuit of their companion. Lord Wah’ter falls several stories and lands perfectly, then runs to the bridges at full speed. Bronyl shouts out to the guards to raise the bridges but Lord Wah’ter leaps over these with ease and the party realise that they are in deep trouble.", "-Dig transforms himself and Tim (who was critically injured and in need of the boost) into sharks so that they can keep up with the more aquatic creatures in their party. Yet even with their speed they could barely keep up with the abomination.", "The Chase", "-Party manage to sneak past the gap in the bridge just in time as they arrive into the depths district where they spot Wah’ter running straight towards the Shellebrity Chef. Ubo curses and wonders why his close friend would choose his restaurant of all places. Perhaps in this creature’s feral rage it acted only on instinct and therefore its own memories? Or maybe Boyd is just a prick hahahaha", "-Wah’ter finds Raphael, Leonardo and Michaelangelo carrying several pots and pans out of the restaurant; basically doing balancing acts. As soon as the three tortles see this creature bounding towards them they dash back inside the restaurant and bolt the doors shut. But Wah’ter smashes through a window and tackles Michaelangelo to the ground. Cutlery, silverware, glass, pottery, everything in the restaurant falls to the ground as the poor tortle is ravaged by the beast. The party make it just in time before any real damage is done and they manage to drive off Wah’ter before he sets off again to the rest of the city. Ubo stays behind to secure the restaurant and to make sure that his workers are safe for the time being. He is fuming.", "-Wah’ter runs into the markets and party continues to follow closely behind; dilemma here as there are many injured in need of attention. Panic ensues in the markets and people are dying left and right while the abomination dashes through. The party stabilise who they can but largely they ignore the citizens of Lantanis, there is little they can do for them now. They concentrate on preventing Wah’ter from doing further damage.", "-They eventually locate him outside the Fighter’s Academy. Master Oogway and General Hydro rush into the building and bolt the doors. The party and Wah’ter have another short scuffle here when the abomination then leaps into the academy itself. ", "-Inside the fighter’s academy the party see that Oogway and Hydro have been knocked out. There are tortle children quivering in a corner and Wah’ter is about to slaughter them all. Tim, even knowing his own life was hanging only by the thinnest of threads, breaks out of his shark form and cast a wall of force between Wah’ter and the children. As Wah’ter swipes down with his trident it glances off the wall and the children run away safely. Had Tim more time to react and thought it through logically he would have created a force field around Wah’ter but the wall was a much easier shape to conjure magically and less casting time.", "-The party are about to descend into the training grounds and confront the abomination but Wah’ter leaps onto the walls where they are situated first. More fighting ensues. The abomination takes many hits and sustains itself through the many attacks by the heroes but eventually he is worn out. Ubo does join the battle halfway after ensuring the security of the Shellebrity Chef and saves the day by strolling over to Wah’ter and gently tapping Wah’ters head with his staff, making this soft ‘bonk’ noise as Wah’ter collapses and returns to his original form.", "-This is when Bronyl and some triton warriors arrive to secure the scene. Wah’ter was going to jail.", "Jailed ", "You didn’t imagine that you’d be staring into a jail cell in the early hours of the morning, not that that means very much down here. But at least out in the city you would see some light and breathe in fresh air. Down here it is dank, musty and miserable. Algae and moss have all but invaded this space, wrapping themselves around columns of seastone and seeping between the cracks in the floor. Occasionally you hear screams from other inmates down the dark, convoluted hallways but otherwise it is as silent as the crypt. The Aquans call this place the Dungeons of Coral, aptly named as coral is a natural barrier from external dangers. But the danger today is your companion, Wah’ter, chained in a cell like a common thief. And slowly, Wah’ters eyes flutter open as he regains consciousness.", "-Wah’ter is completely oblivious to what he has done and when the party confronts him about it, he thinks that they are joking about the fact that he had just massacred the townspeople and some of his family members. ", "-Wah’ter is as confused as they are and the party do not seem to be too forgiving either. Wah’ter was indeed aware that he had an affliction of some sort, although the severity of such he was unsure. This greatly angers the party. Why would he not inform them earlier? Dig is especially pissed. Was this going to be another repeat of Saroza and Styx? Was there anyone he could trust?", "Before long, the King, Bronyl and Baynth have all arrived at Wah’ters cell. Bronyl gives you all a sad look before standing at Poseidon’s side. He has a pained expression, like he can’t bear to see his brother locked up like an animal. Baynth’s face however is creased in fury. His hair is a mess and his eyes are wet. ", "Baynth storms to Wah’ters cell and slams on the deepsteel bars in pure rage. “Monster! Murderer! Abomination!”", "Bronyl speaks up. “Wah’ter did not commit these atrocities of his own volition. It was the curse of our bloodline that caused this, not our brother.”", "“No, Bronyl. This boy let the beast within him win and he lost himself to it because of weakness. Wah’ter, you have taken the two things I love most in this world. You,” Baynth turns his back on you and begins to walk away, “are no brother of mine.”", "Wah’ter frowns. He never considered himself that close to Baynth anyway- but hearing that stings regardless.", "Bronyl steps up to stop Baynth from leaving but Poseidon puts his arm out and says, “No, let him go.” Poseidon then turns to Wah’ter. “Forgive your brother, my child. He is overcome with grief and loss, do not take his words to heart.” Everyone remains silent.", "“This is a… dark day for the House of Nekadh. Scores of Lantanis citizens slaughtered overnight, members of our family lying lifeless in the walls of our home. All because of this cursed blood.” He turns to the party. “How much do you know about our hereditary disease?”", "“Aside from the fact that it turns someone into a killing machine that we barely took down? Not much.” Tim sniggers.", "Gizzard grunts.", "“Even Wah’ter knows very little about our grand house and about the infliction which plagues our bloodline. How could he know? We’ve kept him in the dark all this time, tried to shelter him. Every time he asked us about the changes he was going through, we always dodged the question. Do any of you surface folk follow any gods?”", "The party each relay the god that they worship to the king. Gizzard is proud when he announces the deity that he serves. Tim and Dig however, are not as devout as they once were, considering their revelations when they were in the Udakak Forest. ", "“I see. Most aquans follow two divine beings. The dark beast, who you refer to as the kraken, the ender of worlds and Tenger, who we know as the life giver to all that live in the sea. But the tritons follow one other. The Drowned One. Father of the tritons and warrior divine. Now here’s a question for you to ponder. What is the difference between gods and demons?”", "Ubo wonders if this is a trick question. “Gods are good and demons are evil. That’s so simple... er, your majesty.”", "Poseidon has a sad smile. “What my forefathers believed was that there was no difference between them. You see, what the public do not know is that the Drowned One is in fact… a demon.”", "Silence.", "“When the tritons used to travel between dimensions and planes we encountered the Drowned One in one of the many hells of this universe. He was strong and mighty and beautiful. But even this demon could not best the entire Triton race alone so this demon came up with a cunning plan. He promised the tritons a strength beyond all, fury that even your dwarven berserkers would envy and lightning speed not of this world. Many of the tritons refused this gift. But there was one triton woman who fell in love with this demon and his promises, and likewise he to her. And so eventually the Drowned One would lay with this woman and their offspring would become…” ", "“Your line...” Tim mutters.", "“...the House of Nekadh.”", "Bronyl interjects. “In other words. What you saw tonight was an Aspect of the Drowned One, the demon’s avatar manifested in my brother.”", "Dig looks at Wah’ter, who is all curled up in his cell. “We’ve been travelling with a demon this whole time?” He questions Ubo, “Did you know all this?”", "Ubo recoils slightly. “I... if I had then I would have told you all. You know that.”“Do we?” Dig asks. ", "Gizzard grunts loudly and calmly eases Dig away from the tortle.", "Poseidon continues. “When our bloodline was pure and marriage was within the family, every child would be born with this affliction. Knowing this, I broke millennia of traditions and I married outside of our House. I tried to correct the mistakes of my forefathers but it was still too early and too little. And so only one of my children was affected. We’ve sought all the greatest minds in Lantanis, the best physicians and healers for Wa’hter but… but, you know how that has turned out.”", "“Indeed,” says the wizard.", "Poseidon doesn’t look like the King of Lantanis right now. He looks like a broken father. “Wah’ter. How are you feeling, boy?”", "Wah’ter crumples into himself. “Father, I am undone. I did not want to hurt our people. I did not want to hurt my family.”", "“I did not come here just to give you all a history lesson about my family’s dark past. The city knows that Wah’ter was responsible for the attacks last night, someone must have seen him transform in the Fighter’s Academy. There are now rumours about the House of Nekadh being in allegiance to the enemy. There is a risk of open revolt. If the people find out the truth about the House of Nekadh then the city will collapse upon itself. As king I cannot allow that to happen. So… Lord Wah’ter are you ready to hear this?” As Poseidon speaks, Bronyl has his face in both hands and sheds a few tears. “To preserve the House of Nekadh and to protect the people of Lantanis, I have called for the public execution of Lord Wah’ter, fourth Prince of Lantanis, to be carried out tonight.”", "-The party argues with the king for several minutes as they try to offer alternatives. What started off as respectful suggestions quickly turned into veiled threats as the party attempted to blackmail the king by revealing the truth to the public of Lantanis. It was becoming apparent though that the king’s decision was final. ", "-Wah’ter was generally content with his father’s decision. It’s not like the triton prince was eager to die or anything like that but the fact that he had caused so much pain already was evidence enough for him that he should swing. Even though his companions were all still very much in shock of what he was, they still wanted to protect him from this fate. How touching :’)", "-As all hope seems lost: ", "Poseidon turns to leave with Bronyl but stops halfway down the hall and you hear the distinct sound of something metal falling onto the floor. “I shouldn’t have to say this but, if some people were to help my son leave the city, then I’d have no choice but to brand them as fugitives and exile my son. And imagine the trouble if these fugitives were to infiltrate the temple of the Dark Beast tonight before leaving the city out of the Neptulon gate.”", "Bronyl mutters. “Father, what are you…”", "Poseidon continues, “And if another of my sons were to prepare an escape plan outside Lantanis for these people, then I’d have to exile him too for the time being until I resolved matters. Hmm?”", "Bronyl’s eyes widen and he quickly rushes out of the dungeons without a word. Poseidon chuckles to himself and likewise leaves you and your party alone in the Dungeons of Coral.", "-Key is left behind on the dungeon floors and the party promptly use it to open the cell for Wah’ter. ", "-They discuss how they are going to get Wah’ter out of the city. Gizzard leaves early as they are discussing these plans because he loses interest and has a short attention span. There are several methods proposed, including having an execution take place with a body double. The body double would most likely be a triton in the dungeons of coral who they would unwillingly sacrifice to the block in order to give the illusion to the public (as well as fool the king) that the fourth prince of Lantanis had been executed. The other main option was to follow through with the king’s idea (railroaded ggez). The last choice was to stage a prison break and cause general chaos in the city while they all made their escape", "-In the end the party decided to follow through with the king’s plan somewhat. However, they also needed to make sure that their allies in the city, that is, their fleet, would also escape with them. Their security would not be guaranteed following their escape with Wah’ter as fugitives. ", "-Therefore, their plan was to first secure the escape of their allies, finish any errands that they had in the city before nightfall, and then infiltrating the temple of the Dark Beast for leads to the Kraken. ", "-But we all know that plans sometimes don’t always go to plan (get hyped for next sesh boys)", "-Wah’ter is transformed into a baby turtle and placed into Tim’s bag of holding. Wah’ter wants to object but instead, this turns into angry snapping, grunting and squeaking- or at least as angry as a baby turtle can sound.", "THE EXILED PRINCE", "Traversing the city", "-The city has been fairly damaged after the recent attack. The people are still in shock and many are absolutely filled with hatred against Lord Wah’ter. Several dead citizens are still being transported out of the most affected areas, namely the Shellebrity Chef and the markets.", "-As they walk they overhear rumours of Lord Wah’ter and the House of Nekadh being actual monsters in disguise. There has always been conspiracies against the ruling family and other nonsensical drivel by the public masses but now it didn’t seem that far fetched anymore. As soon as these conversations popped up, the Wavekept would be there to detain these individuals and send them off into the Dungeons of Coral. Public order was definitely declining steadily. ", "Deepsmith", "-Gizzard visits the Deepsmithy alone and to speak with Lachlan. Lachlan Ness is sad because he heard bad news about his friend Wah’ter. The conversation between the both of these people is, as expected, dull and basic. They are not exactly bards (although that would probably be a curse in itself for this campaign). ", "-Gizzard happily accepts his new hammer, which seems to be basically the same weapon as his old one but upgraded. This one comes with more sea serpent and a Bunnings snag. ", "-Ubo’s shell is still damaged at this point. If Gizzard showed any signs of concern towards the acid attack victim then he would mention it to Lach Ness but his mind is still racing over the fact that he had a bigger smashing thing. ", "-But he doesn’t leave the smithy in peace. Gizzard mentions to Lachlan that Wah’ter is still in the cell (he left as the party discussed their escape) and that he needed some help. This was all the information that the Deepsmithy needed because tonight he was going to stage a prison break. As Lachlan Ness retired his profession and raced towards the Dungeons of Coral, Gizzard took the time to ransack any potentially valuable items here.", "Embassy", "-All of the companions here are curious about whether Wah’ter really is a demon and what is happening", "-Tim explains to them all that they need to leave. Taylah agrees immediately, well, at least after some short convincing by Dig as does the Imperial Navy captain (who I shall introduce in a later sesh). But the pirates led by Isabella do not seem to want to budge. Tim tells her that they cannot guarantee her safety should she continue to stay within the city but she is adamant in her decision. She tells Tim that she and the gang will follow Dustin to raid the Vault of the Tritons instead. This greatly irks Wah’ter who can do nothing but struggle within the bag of holding. Tim throws her off the scent a little with some misinformation. ", "-Unit A.B. is there the whole time but continues to stare out the window into the wide open ocean. I wonder what she is thinking?", "Sturn Words", "-Night arrives and the party undergo the infiltration. They walk through the city in the quiet of the night. They reach the gates of the Oceanus district and are confronted by guards. One of the guard seems to be loyal to Lord Wah’ter and asks of his whereabouts and safety. The heroes are cautious but this man seems to be genuine so they assure him that they will protect his prince if they are allowed entry. This grants them access past the gates.", "-However, they are soon stopped by none other than Sturn the Quick, another prince of the House of Nekadh. He sees through the ruse and interrogates Tim. When he notices Tim eyeing the bag of holding he quickly shoots for it. Dig attempts to apprehend him by casting a banishing spell but barely misses as the triton tears the bag away and sends Wah’ter flying out. ", "-The party watches as Sturn presses Wah’ter against a wall with a knife to his neck. Everyone reaches for their weapon but do not move as any sudden movement could cause the death of their companion. Wah’ter tries to calm his brother down but there is little he can say as he was responsible for the death of his wife, Lug. Still, he tells his brother that it was because of the curse that he could not control and that he would never do anything to Lug. Lug was like a mother to Wah’ter, the mother that he never had. ", "-This, Sturn believes. He lets Wah’ter go begrudgingly and storms off into the night in search of more answers. Before he leaves, the party finds that he has left some cultist robes on the ground and a white mask (a mask which fits Gizzard’s snout only). ", "Getting inside", "Six robed figures stand at the top of the stairs to the entrance of the temple. They are in the way between you and two large metal doors which bar the way forward. As some other Dark Beast worshippers approach the entrance, you see them exchange a few words before the six step aside and the doors slowly slide open. You get the briefest glimpse into the temple as the doors are ajar, an eerie amber glow is present from within. As the doors shut tight behind them with a resounding thud, you wonder if this is really a good idea after all.", "You take cautious steps forward with the rest of your party and immediately the six cultists’ attention turns to you. They say not a word but wait as you walk up the stone stairs, silently watching you like gargoyles as you slowly ascend.", "When you finally reach the top, you get a better look at these people. Two of these cultists approach you, their hoods obscuring most of their face and wearing dark red robes which cover their entire body. You can tell that one of them is a merman and the other is a Zoran but they have sickly lesions on their faces and there is a ghastly smell wafting from their rotten teeth. ", "The merman cultist says, “You approach the Temple of the Dark Beast, acolytes. What is your purpose?”", "-Party manage to lie and fake their enthusiasm for the kraken and ask for entry into the temple. Wah’ter thinks to himself that this cultist sounds like some sort of rapist (why do I have such a good rapey voice wtf lol)", "The other cultist, the Zoran begins to circle around your party, whispering into your ears. “The Dark Beast welcomes all into his halls. In his image we are all reborn and are given release from our corrupted vessels. Yes… yes, I sense a certain strength of spirit in you all, good…”", "As the Zoran returns to his post, the merman nods. “If you are truly devoted to him, then you must know the password. Otherwise…” the merman gestures behind him with a bony, rotting finger. ", "He is clearly pointing to the other four cultists. They are tritons for sure. But…Gizzard, Dig and Ubo are unsettled by what they see.", "There is something wrong with them. Something unnatural. If you listen closely, you can almost hear a faint groan from them like they’re in pain. Then you realise why. Their eyes have been hollowed out, mere black sockets remain where their eyes once were, their ears have been torn off so that two scars run parallel down the sides of their heads and their mouths have been sewn shut with deepsteel wire. ", "The party sincerely hope that doesn’t happen to them.", "The Merman chuckles. “We simply wish to worship our god in peace but the Houses of Nekadh would offend us holy men. These four were once royal guard in their service sent to deceive us, but now they have been remade whole and serve the Dark Beast with all their heart and mind. So I ask once again, do you know the password?”", "-They obviously do not know the password. Gizzard does some quick thinking of his own and calls out Wah’ter as being a spy from the House of Nekadh and is in need of the same treatment as these ‘hollow ones’. Wah’ter, with strange enthusiasm I might add, plays along and allows himself to be apprehended. Bingo. Wah’ter has gained entry. But what about the others?", "-Tim uses his detect thoughts spell to see the surface thinking of this cultist. As the merman asks once more, the password is plain in his mind. Tim doesn’t risk delving any deeper and probing because this would blow their cover, even tempting as it is. ", "“Tentacles,” Tim finally says with confidence.", "Dig and Ubo collectively though to themselves: I knew it was tentacles. It was so obvious.", "The merman edges in closer to your face so that you can now smell the putrid stench almost clouding all your senses. Then he chuckles and both the cultists step aside as the metal doors slide open mechanically once more. ", "The Zoran gestures to the open temple. “Welcome back, brothers. May the Dark Beast keep you in his embrace!”", "As the party step through the opening doors the laughter from the Zoran cultist trails behind them. What were they getting themselves into now?", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

                    "Text": ["THE TEMPLE OF THE DARK BEAST", "Entering the Temple", "The doors groan behind you as they grind to a shut. Here you are; the temple of the Dark Beast. You are quite glad that your companions are beside you because on all fronts you are surrounded by cultists in their crimson robes and white masks. Pools of stagnant water line the pathway to the main room. The water’s surface shimmers slightly as you stride past, illuminating you with this eerie emerald green. You peer into the pools expecting to see your reflection but you swear that you saw the face of a drowned man. There is little time to ponder on this however, as you step through into the main hall. ", "You step inside. What were you expecting for a temple with such a sinister name? Perhaps there’d be wine goblets made of skulls, horned demons whipping slaves as the kraken feasted on the souls of the damned. Maybe even a fountain of blood in the centre of it all while sirens serenaded you? But no, for all your imagination, this temple is rather mundane.", "-A bit more description of the temple: blueish-green colours and tentacles coiling around pillars like vines, there are like three hundred cultists altogether gathered here, not including the ‘Hollowed Ones’ that are walking around. ", "-Already you can feel the tilt coming from Wah’ters direction. But right now it’s not too bad, maybe just a 5 degree tilt, just wait till later on", "-Gizzard is escorting Wah’ter around like he is a prisoner. If you remember from the previous session, Wah’ter was only granted entry because Gizzard outed him as a spy that needed to undergo the ‘hollowing’ treatment", "-The party know why are they here. They have been ordered by the king to search for some leads for leviathan. They therefore cannot afford to blow their cover; not to mention that they will be quickly overrun by the hundreds of cultist swarming this temple right now", "-Tim check with Barnabus for any intel. Unfortunately, as Barnabus has told him upon entering Lantanis, they have never been in this city in the other cycles. This is worrying because it means that the celestial arm would have very little insight for the events to come- the party would be playing it by ear and dancing in the dark. ", "-Dig and Tim split off to have a chat to a curious cultist. The curious cultist remarks that he has never seen Dig or Tim here before. Tim introduces himself as Heronimus and Dig as Cultasio? Curatio? I can’t remember. But the bottom line is that these are the most un-aquan sounding names I have ever heard in my life. Still, Dig takes the first opportunity he has to book it out of this situation as he makes his way towards a welcoming cultist.", "The Curious Cultist", "-Tim unfortunately is still caught in the interrogation by the curious cultist. The curious cultist pounces on the foreign name immediately and remarks that he has never seen the likes of Tim around before. Tim explains that this is because he is still rather new to this temple and that he has devoted his life to the dark beast in other means. The cultist is confused but apologises for his lack of trust towards the newcomer. Apparently, there have been rumours of ... spies recently. Tim is perfectly understanding of course. He would never want this temple to be infiltrated by... spies. ", "-The cultist then goes to shake Tim’s hand and although Tim is reluctant at first, goes to reciprocate the gesture. The cultist reels back in horror upon seeing the human hand shake his own. What is a surfacer doing here in this sacred temple? The cultist is ready to scream to everyone gathered in this hall but Tim does some quick thinking of his own and explains that the worship of the dark beast has extended to all corners of the globe, including the surface world. ", "-This wizard must be either extremely charismatic or extremely lucky, because the cultist seems satisfied with this explanation. He welcomes Tim to the Temple of the Dark Beast and gives some vital information to Tim: the cult leader has ties to the royal family. Of course Tim chooses to almost jeopardise the entire party when he refers to the cult leader as a ‘he’. Little did he know that the cult leader was actually the high priestess and well... a woman. Again the cultist is about to scream but Tim makes a joke: “It is hard to tell with the robes and the mask sometimes, you know what I mean?” Ha. Ha. Ha. The party is doomed... NOPE, actually this man is a comedy genius and has the cultist slapping his thighs in laughter. Well done, Tim of Felbourne, you might have missed your true calling as a bard.", "The Welcoming Cultist ", "-Dig has strutted off to talk to the welcoming cultist because he looks like a welcoming cultist and seems to have a very welcoming demeanour for a cultist who is welcoming. ", "-Dig asks for a tour from him and is ecstatically given a personal run through of the temple. He is first led to the sacrificial stone where the cultist reveals is his personal feature here. Apparently many sacrifices have been carried out on this altar and that there was going to be a main special event tonight: a mermaid. Dig smiles awkwardly and pretends to be excited for the upcoming ritual kill. The cultist falls for Dig’s apparent penchant for sadism and lets some vital information slip from his tongue. There were human prisoners being held below in a place called the red room", "-Dig pretends to care little and expresses that he cannot wait for the ritual sacrifices to begin. He enquires about who these human prisoners are but it seems that the cultist doesn’t know much himself. The cultist finishes the tour by showing him a hallway which would lead to the high priestess’ room and the entrance to the red room (prison). Dig thanks him and the cultists part ways. As Dig goes to meet up with the rest of his companions, he sees the curious cultist slapping his thigh and laughing hysterically. What has that wizard done this time?", "The Devout Cultist", "-Gizzard escorts the prisoner Wah’ter into a side room. Ubo decides to follow along. Gizzard is now thinking to himself of how much of a butt-buddy this tortle is to this triton. But he keeps it to himself for now", "-The three of them enter a room where there is a statue of what is presumably the kraken. If you can imagine the statue, it is basically some ‘Cthulu’ looking thing outfitted with all the tentacles, evil eyes, and dark angst-filled anime characters you would expect", "-Anyway, there is a lone cultist here that is naked save for his white mask that is kneeling on the ground and screaming praises towards the statue. Gizzard notices that the cultist has numerous scars all over his back and is freshly bleeding from slashing wounds. Ubo sees that there is a blood-soaked whip next to the cultist’s feet. It doesn’t take much of a genius for the trio to come to the conclusion that this is some avid flagellant. ", "-Gizzard sneaks past the cultist who is still caught up in his worship and takes the whip by his side. He is going to put it to some good use. He even gives some cheeky taps on his prisoner, Wah’ter, for some added spice.", "-The three of them exit the room to meet up with the rest of the party to discuss what they have learnt. As the lizardman is walking he notices that the handle of the whip is able to be unscrewed. Inside he is rewarded with a key. But what is it for? He gives it to Dig Bickman for safe keeping- he is the most reliable in the party after all. Additionally, Dig is the only one that knows that Gizzard isn’t just a dumb brute thanks to them sharing the draconic tongue. ", "-Gizzard makes a joke about Ubo being just an extension of Wah’ter and not having a mind of his own, which pisses the tortle off incredibly. Ubo wishes that he could smack the mask that was hanging off of Gizzard’s snout. ", "The Hungry Cultist", "-The party make their way to the west corridors where Tim and Dig split from them, deciding to investigate to the north", "-Gizzard, Wah’ter and Ubo (who btw CHOSE to follow Wah’ter because it was his choice and not because...) follow their noses and end up in what looks like the kitchen for these demon worshippers. There seems to be an absolute miss maud smorgasbord going on here; there are burgers, buns, soups and other food", "-Ubo is concerned that there is poison in the food and goes to test. Ubo, looking back in hindsight, realises that the cultists would be very special to poison their own food. Regardless, Ubo does deem the food to be safe and would even take some for himself but something bothers him. Upon closer inspection, he arrives at the shocking truth; that this food is actually made of aquan meat. Triton burgers, mermaid sashimi, and worst of all... tortle soup", "-One thing leads to another and Ubo’s cover is blown as all forty cultists in the kitchen begin to swarm him. Thankfully, instead of attacking him on sight they are all fighting for his signature and asking him why he decided to join their order. Ubo would be more than happy to address his fans but not only are these men evil cultists, they are tortle-soup drinking evil cultists- and that Ubo will NOT stand by >:(", "-Unfortunately this prompts one of the cultists, the hungry cultist, to ask for Ubo’s opinion on the dreaded tortle soup. All eyes are on the elemental warrior now, there is no easy way to back out of this. He thinks to himself: Maybe I could ask the wizard or the sorcerer to cast an illusion or prestidigitation? No, that’d be impossible they’re too far away. Maybe Gizzard could cause a distraction while I scurried away? No, it’s Gizzard he isn’t reliable. Ubo resigns himself to his fate and takes a huge swig of the tortle soup ", "-He holds it in his mouth, trying his hardest not to succumb to his gag reflex as a bit of tortle bone prods his throat. He smiles, pretending to savour the taste of his brethren while the cultists look on in anticipation. Ubo gives a weak thumbs up, much to the elation of the cultists in the mess hall as they leap around, proclaiming the skill of the cooks. As they are caught in the revelry Ubo quickly spits all of the soup into his shell. Now, from the leg holes of his shell, yellow-brown gunk is flowing down the sides of his legs and onto the floor to form these sick puddles of warm soup. Ubo races out into a pool just outside the kitchen and out of view, wading around as the soup slowly turns the blue water into brown. Ubo shrugs and decides to relieve himself as this is happening; nothing more to lose now anyhow", "-Wah’ter is absolutely sickened by the triton burgers. He is quietly seething to himself and wanting to scream out and murder all of these monsters. But first off, he is being chased by Gizzard around the table while narrowly avoiding lashes from the whip that the lizardman had found, and secondly he knew that blowing his cover now would most likely lead to the death of him and his companions. Therefore, Wah’ter begrudgingly accepts the predicament they are in and allows for Gizzard to make a mockery of him. Him, the triton prince of Lantanis, reduced to this. (This is the beginning of Boyd’s salt. That and the fact that he was getting like 6000ping LELELELLELEL)", "-Gizzard overhears the cultists talking about their surprise that Ubo would join the cult- especially because there was going to be a staged attack on his restaurant in the city. Of course, Gizzard doesn’t find this to be a necessary tidbit of information to relay back to the leaking tortle.", "The Foolish Cultist", "-Dig and Tim introduce themselves to a cultist who appears to be guarding a treasure room. The cultist is called Rufus and he is not the brightest person that they have ever encountered in their adventures so far. ", "-He seems harmless enough and quickly warms up to the two of them as they express how important he is to the head priestess and that he has duties elsewhere. The cultist does show exceptional loyalty but his lack of intelligence allows him to be swiftly overwhelmed by the pair of these brainiacs", "-Whilst Rufus jumps into the urine/vomit pool of Ubo’s making, Tim guards the door and Dig uses the key given to him by Gizzard to unlock the treasure room. Inside, he finds 500 gold bars, a scroll containing a single aquan word, and a strange ancient elven device. Tim later goes in to retrieve ten gold bars", "-A group of cultists do eventually stroll on by to find Tim guarding the entrance. The wizard quickly salvages the situation by placing the blame on Rufus- which the cultists seem to buy perfectly. Tim wins these guys over as well and they reveal to him that they are all in anticipation of the hellfire caches that have been planted all over the city. Tim fakes his excitement as well and secretly plots to ignite any caches of hellfire still in the temple. This group of cultists also spend some time in the urine pool", "-Eventually Rufus does come back to guard the entrance, knocking the door open in the process. Any reasonable person would dob Dig and Tim there and then, but Dig calmly locks the door and Tim tells Rufus that his secret mission would require him to be silent. Rufus doesn’t see anything wrong here and so the two of them get away with the greatest temple heist of the century.", "-The party rendezvous again in the urine pool after all the cultists have left their vicinity. Only Gizzard has enough sense to stay out of the strange looking water as the party discuss their next moves. Wah’ter, upon hearing that there were now stores of hellfire stashed all around the city, is livid. He questions the Sethon, the wavekept, the royal family, the general functioning of the city. Why was Lantanis so disorganised? Why were they so incompetent? This was not the Lantanis that he loved. If he was thinking with his head, he might have started to piece together information that would allow him to understand the situation better, but understandably he was overwhelmed by emotions. ", "The Hallway ", "-Upon the mention of hellfire caches, Gizzard darts off from the party in order to find them and destroy them. Tim manages to cast a telepathic bond spell just as the lizardman disappears from view. Gizzard has absolutely no leads whatsoever and chances upon a loyal cultist sitting near the front of the temple. The loyal cultist looks at Gizzard in confusion. He is seeing some overgrown lizardman with a mask on his snout holding a blood-stained whip. Gizzard begins to flagellate, whipping himself bloody and raw until red blood and plasma is now caking his back. Gizzard beams with joy and hands the whip over to this cultist, who delights in the pleasure. The cultist whips and whips Gizzard until his arms give out. There is now pools of blood dripping from Gizzard’s wounds from his back, actual manifestations of his dedication to the cause- and perhaps that he himself did enjoy getting whipped just a little. The cultist admires Gizzard for his devotion to the cause and tells him that the hellfire caches were locked up in the red room along with the prisoners. Satisfied, Gizzard regroups with the rest of the party. ", "-Wah’ter is still fuming, saline levels at an all time high, saying very little as the party continues their way to the eastern corridors. These corridors would lead to the red room where the prisoners were supposedly being held, as well as the high priestess’ room which they knew would be heavily guarded or at least difficult to gain access to. Wah’ter then sneakily undoes his shackles but the DM tells everyone by accident. The NaCl increases once more", "-The very first doorman warns the party that they are not allowed access into this restricted hallway. Dig begins to talk his way out of it, attempting to manipulate the cultist into allowing them to see the high priestess. However, this is quickly shut down as Wah’ter steps forward and breaks the cultist’s neck. The party are frozen momentarily, they have never seen the triton prince act out in rage before. Perhaps this triton was more... human than they realised. ", "-As the cultist crumples to the ground, the party hears a knock from the other side of the doorway that would lead to the High Priestess’ room. Dig presses his body against the door and responds that the doorman was out of commission. This stirs up some suspicion as the cultist on the other side of the door comes to investigate. This leaves Gizzard, Ubo and Wah’ter to quickly carry the corpse down the hallway and dump it there", "The Red Room (Prison)", "-This unruly trio haul the corpse off down the hallway and into the entrance for the red room. There are stairs leading down into the prison where humans are being held, but guarding these stairs are two dark beast cultists. They spot the three instantly as they drop the corpse onto the ground. One of them is about to scream but is quickly silenced as Wah’ter darts forward, tackles him to the ground and begins to tear the cultist into pieces. Gizzard and Ubo are about to intervene to take care of the other but Wah’ter gets there first and murders him as well. The sight of Wah’ter killing so brutally doesn’t seem to affect Gizzard, who is accustomed to this sort of mentality in the swamps, or Ubo, who is in fact just an extension of Wah’ter anyway", "-The three of them descend into the dank and dark red room where immediately they are taken aback by the stench of piss and shit. They spot the prisoners instantly, there about six humans, one human skeleton (dead ofc, no undead antics here), and one lizardfolk", "-Gizzard isn’t too surprised at seeing this green lizardman. Gizzard values strength and courage, all the manliest traits you can think of. Seeing this lizardman who was emaciated, dehydrated, weak and whimpering definitely inspired no sympathy from the prince. Gizzard offered to mercy kill the lizardman, thus preserving his honour. The prisoner agreed, but just before the hammer would come down and squash him into smithereens, he parted with some knowledge. Apparently the lizard wizard had been spotted back in the swamp homelands but not alone... he was with a ‘green woman who had an owl with her’. Furthermore, they had taken base in the dragon temple and had begun to conduct more ritual sacrifices of the Arafura citizens. Gizzard grunts and brings the hammer down on the poor lizardman. He knew he needed to go home soon. ", "-The rest of the prisoners do not look so great either. They’ve obviously been tortured, mentally drilled, broken down. The three men and three women remaining are all at wit’s end. Upon seeing Wah’ter and Ubo, and of course the lizardman who just got his head smashed like a pumpkin, they are driven into even more of a panic as they all retreat to the corner of the room. The three learn that these humans are actually from the imperial fleet and pirate crews but were ambushed during their stay in the city. This is when the party spots the caches of hellfire which have been put inside locked crates. The gunpowder/nitrate smell of the caches gave it away to Ubo ", "-Wah’ter has very little time for these prisoners. His mind is still occupied with rage- the incompetence of the city and the atrocities being committed by these cultists under their very noses- incurs Wah’ters wrath. Gizzard and Ubo are slightly concerned; Gizzard being more worried that Wah’ter might turn into that abomination again. Gizzard and Wah’ter collectively mercy kill four of these prisoners so that only two women remain. One of them is pregnant of course because I like drama. Anyway, this doesn’t seem to deter Wah’ter much from making a decision between the two. You see, most of these prisoners were too unfit to live anyway and so killing them was probably the most ethically sound thing they could do. Also, how were they going to be able to get these prisoners out anyway? At the very end, there was only one prisoner remaining, the woman. ", "-Wah’ter summoned some elemental sprites with his abomination magic and had them carry the prisoner to safety but the prisoner refused. Instead, she pointed to the hellfire caches which Ubo had sniffed out and made the call. She was going to stay behind and light the fuse. But the party needed something like a signal to know when she was going to light it, or some magical stopwatch. Gizzard came up with the idea: they would count to 200 and then they would blow this temple to kingdom come. ", "The High Priestess’ Room", "-Gizzard, Ubo and Wah’ter barely make it with the corpse to the other room down the hallway when the door bursts open and the cultist comes to investigate. Instead of the usual doorman that guarded the high priestess’ room, there is instead a guilty-looking Tim and Dig. Tim puts on a smile and explains that there was something going on with Rufus and that they went to investigate. Although the cultist doesn’t seem to be too convinced, it seems that they are in a rush. Dig and Tim peer into the room to see an entourage of cultists, possibly forty or so, accompanying a woman. This had to be the high priestess- she was most DEFINITELY a woman, she was THICC. In any case, Tim and Dig respectfully bow as the entourage walks past them, leaving the entrance to her room clear", "-Tim and Dig quickly dart into the room to find another door which would lead directly into her ‘office’. Dig checks for traps and Tim does the same using his magic. Dig’s Eye of Melora softly hums and this prompts Dig to warily open the door. They take cautious steps forward into the room but feel a strange sensation as their body almost feels weightless and their mind clear. In the blink of an eye they do not find themselves in a room within the temple of the dark beast, but instead (judging by the brickwork and the aesthetics of where they’ve ended up) are standing in the royal palace of Lantanis", "-Tim asks Barnabus what the hell is going on. Barnabus, if he had a physical body, would shrug but tells Tim to tread carefully. Dig questions why the high priestess’ would have direct access to the royal palace. The both of them could taste the lingering magic in the air, this was no coincidence- they had travelled through a Gate (super high level spell btw which just for some interesting trivia, Doran the explorer first used and surprised Tim back in the early days) ", "-They were in the room of one of Wah’ter’s sisters. It had to be either Wolyn or Aryn, which was extremely worrying. This was incriminating because it meant the high priestess was in allegiance to members of the royal family or the high priestess was actually... neither Dig nor Tim wanted to believe in that possibility. There was so much mystery now surrounding the House of Nekadh. They were already beginning to doubt Wah’ters integrity ever since his transformation into that horrifying abomination. Now they would also have to question how much he knew of his family’s involvement with the cult. Was this all some elaborate trap to kill off the party? Filled with questions, the two spellcasters race back through the Gate before it disappears and they quickly rush to divulge what they have learnt with the rest of the party", "The Sacrifice", "-The party make their way towards the front of the temple as the head cultist begins their speech. Keeping in mind that the prisoner in the red room downstairs is still counting down before lighting this whole place to hell, you would think the party would act with some sense of urgency. They don’t.", "-Wah’ter’s elemental sprites, who were originally tasked with carrying a prisoner out, count silently to themselves while the party watch the high priestess ascend to the stage behind the main altar:", "The leader of these cultists are not who you’d expect. She’s slender and tall. Beautiful too even though you can’t see her face which is concealed by a white mask. The robe wraps around her slim waist and around the generous curves of her body. She looks rather familiar but you can’t place your finger on it. ", "She croaks out, “Gloriam tenebris bestia.” ", "Everyone chants in unison, “Gloriam tenebris bestia.”", "Barnabus whispers, “That’s abyssal for ‘Glory to the Dark Beast’. These guys mean business.”", "The cult leader stretches out both hands. “As the House of Nekadh sits complacently atop their corrupted throne and festers, the faithful of this city lie patient for the return of the Dark Beast. Our god is a mighty god that neither the Drowned One nor Tenger the Lifegiver could ever hope to best. Let us raise a toast to the journey of salvation!”", "The water sprites continue to count down: “175,", "174, 173...”", "“Long have we waited for this moment my brothers and sisters. At long last we are ready to let the Dark Beast wash this city anew and have it reborn in its perfect image.”", "The crowd erupts into cheers.", "“As you all are aware, our lord is invincible to all mortal efforts. However, we must protect him from being banished from our realm. As such, I have sent our finest to defend the three shrines in the Darkest Reaches. These shrines, as you are aware, are like the ‘anchors’ which allows the Dark Beast to fully materialize in this world.”", "-The party gather that in the Darkest Reaches there are some shrines to the Dark Beast which are allowing the kraken to have some physical presence in this world. They quickly gather that venturing to these shrines and destroying these anchors will greatly aid in the defeat of the kraken. Killing the kraken now seemed like a pipe dream, but at least they would be able to banish it back to some other higher planes.", "-The high priestess continues to speak about the general plan and the plans for tonight. There would be random terror attacks at some main sites; including the shellebrity chef, the barracks, markets and so forth. They had also planted a bomb. The location of this bomb was known only to the high priestess and a select few members. It was now evident to the party that although they needed to skip town and fast, they would also be unable to leave in good conscience without at least dealing with this new threat. Not to mention Wah’ter would never forgive the party if they left his beloved city in shambles. They had some work to do. ", "-The elemental sprites continue to count down: “75,", "74, 73...”", "-The High Priestess wishes to bless the entire room and in good old fashioned cultist style- she decides that the best way to do so is by ritual sacrifice. The victim tonight was some mermaid. Her eyes had been put out, arms cut off and the scales from her lower fish half were ripped off to reveal the fleshy underlay. The High Priestess looks around and spots the party so of course she invites them forward to the front of the temple so that they can carry it out in front of everyone. ", "-When Wah’ter is face to face with the cultist, because prior to this he had taken his mask off out of irritation, the High Priestess freezes for a moment. Wah’ter himself also is taken aback when he comes to the realisation that this High Priestess’ voice and demeanour were unmistakeable. The High Priestess was his sister, Wolyn herself. ", "-All of the hundreds of cultists gathered in the main hall wait anxiously as the party contemplate their next moves. The two choices were obvious, either carry out the sacrifice and possibly get some more brownie points with the cultists, or free the prisoner and endanger their position. For a brief few moments it almost seemed like the party would commit the unthinkable and sacrifice this unfortunate aquan, but their heroic nature wins out eventually and the party prepare their grand escape", "Chaos in the Temple", "-The party look at each other and no words are spoken. It was time for action now. Dig shouts a few choice words at the cultists gathered before bringing his Malvisier’s Gauntlets together to cast a cone of cold spell down one half of the room. Close to one hundred cultists are instantly turned into aquan iceblocks as Dig unleashes his magic on them. Despite being worshippers of a demon, the cultists are now frozen (pun intended) in fear at the sight of the true demon before them; Dig motherfucking Bickman. The sorcerer presses his claws against the neck of the High Priestess and threatens to kill her if any of the cultists make a sudden move.", "-At this point there is a standoff as none of the cultists or the heroes want to make the first move. Any mistake here would lead to the utter destruction of either party. Tim edges his hands closer to the mermaid, calming her down and securing her in his arms. Gizzard grunts and walks closer to the High Priestess Wolyn, pressuring her to get closer to Dig. Ubo grasps firmly on his elemental quarterstaff and asks his friend Wah’ter, “What’s the timer at?”", "-Wah’ter realises that nobody had been paying much attention to the countdown of the elemental sprites. He wonders what number they are at. ", "The elemental sprites, emotionless, continue, “15, 14...” ", "Wah'ter smirks. “Oh shit.”", "-Dig casts dimension door and yanks Wolyn by the sleeve of her robe as he leaps into it head first. ", "-Tim, although a very capable wizard, has little time to think of a spell in his head to get them out of there. It seemed that he was going to rely on more traditional methods of escape- that being to run the hell out of there. He hoists the mermaid onto his shoulder and begins sprinting down the main hall towards the temple entrance where they came in from. A mob of cultists leap towards his position with their tridents drawn ready to end this man but Tim quickly casts a misty step and appears on the other end of the room.", "-Gizzard, Wah’ter and Ubo have already begun to sprint to catch up to Tim. Wah’ter kills as many cultists as he can along the way as he bolts down, anger still welling up in him. He wanted this whole place to burn to the ground, he wanted them all to pay for their insurrection. Ubo runs remarkably well for a tortle, who are typically not renowned for their running speed. You could probably chalk this up to the fact that he trained as an elemental warrior and was manipulating the very air around him. But the most likely explanation is that he didn’t want to die lmao", "-Gizzard overtakes the runners within an instant as his muscular legs propel him to great strides. He sees Tim struggling and with one hand snatches the mermaid and props it on his own shoulder before taking off out the main door. The mermaid’s head smacks against the door frame on the way out and she is momentarily knocked unconscious", "-The entire party eventually rush down the stairs of the temple onto the streets and begin panting heavily. Dig falls out of the dimension door with Wolyn, who Gizzard quickly scoops up in his other arm and places over his free shoulder. Wolyn is not bound, but any smart person would think twice before trying to anger an angry lizardman. ", "-The count reaches zero and nothing happens yet. The party wonder whether the prisoner actually had second thoughts before- there is a sudden explosion of fireworks as the temple erupts like an active volcano, spewing molten hellfire and sparking up. You could barely hear the screams of the cultists inside as the building imploded and collapsed on itself as the hellfire crackled and popped, melting the deepsteal beams. (Interesting to note: Hellfuel can melt deepsteal beams)", "-To make matters worse, they could now hear guards approaching in the distance from the reef gate. How was this possible? Wah’ter was proud of the city’s security forces but this was efficient even for them... much too efficient. Still, there was little time to dwell on this. What were they going to do now? There was the issue of the terror attacks, the bomb which would probably blow up the whole city, the guards now searching for their position, and the issue of escape. What about Wolyn and this mermaid? The party frantically weigh up their options and their next moves but it becomes clear to them that Wah’ter wasn’t going to leave without setting some things right. But for now, they needed to get out of this area.", "-Oh yeah, and Gizzard gives his mask to Wah’ter so that he could preserve his dignity. He was naked this whole time, after all. ", "THE ESCAPE", "The Coral Gate Checkpoint", "You dash out of the temple while disorienting flashes of light and screams echo down the streets. You feel sick to your core, especially Wah’ter, because now it seems all hell is about to break loose in the city. As if like clockwork, you are soon exposed to eruptions of blinding light from the depths district below which are then accompanied by howling, maniacal laughter and the sound of fighting in the streets. The people of Lantanis are under attack and there is a bomb somewhere in the city. But at the same time you can’t stay here for long because if you are captured you are as good as dead. ", "It is now time for you guys to make the choice between what is right, and what is easy.You rush yourselves over to the bridge and towards the coral gate, as Wah’ter instructs you. You notice that on the surface Ubo is in control of his emotions but you feel as if there’s something stirring within him, like a pent up inferno of rage. You worry for your tortle friend. But right now you have something else to worry about. ", "In front of you as you reach the guard bridge you come to an immediate halt. There is a line of people, mostly royal servants, sightseers, temple goers and the like. The gate has been slammed shut and there are about twenty guards in front of it. The looks on the faces of these people are of uncertainty and of confusion. As you get closer you hear, “What’s going on?”", "“Why are we being trapped in here?”", "“Do you think that Wah’ter is behind all of this?”", "“I see fire, how is that possible we are underwater!”", "Soon, one of the triton guards slams his trident on the ground, silencing the crowd momentarily as the guard announces. “No one is to leave the Oceanus District under the order of King Poseidon. All citizens are asked to remain in a single file as we confirm your identity. Please remain calm. This will be handled by the Wavekept.” The guards are now going down the line one by one, it will only be a matter of time before they get to your group at the back.", "-Behind them the guards from earlier were also advancing upon their position. They didn’t have time to be standing around but they also doubted their ability to fight through all these guards. Besides, Wah’ter would probably turn against them if they actively killed his own citizens; they were only doing their duty as directed by the House of Nekadh. The House of Nekadh...", "-The party decide that they were going to talk out of it. But they weren’t going to do the talking themselves personally. Since they had a representative of the House of Nekadh, at least one that wasn’t currently a fugitive anyhow, they were going to make Wolyn have the guards part way for them. Wolyn was in no position to refuse. Gizzard made this obvious when he flexed his arm and almost crushed her against his taut back. ", "-Wolyn is let go for the time being and she makes her way to the guard captain. The party wait in nervous anticipation as she opens her mouth to say... “Those people are enemies of the state who have held me hostage and threatened to kill me. Arrest these men at once.”", "-The party quickly spring into action and Gizzard has Wolyn once again. Tim threatens the guards. They were going to kill one of the princesses of Lantanis if they didn’t let them through. He didn’t feel good doing it but they were left with no other option. Ubo reassures the public that this was all a misunderstanding and that all would be explained in time. Wah’ter slinks further into a teething rage. The man was getting very stressed. And you didn’t want to see him when he was fully stressed. ", "Sturn Words", "-Once out of the bridge they are in the depths district and seen by Sturn. He asks the party about what is going on and what they have learnt. After divulging this information to the brother, the party is informed that Bronyl was awaiting them at the Poseidon gate with sea horses. ", "-Before they leave, Sturn puts an arm on Wah’ters shoulder and touches his forehead against his. Sturn tells Wah’ter that he wasn’t sure what was going on but pleaded for him to ‘save the city’. What’s more, Sturn smiled at Wah’ter and told him that he forgave him. Wah’ter at this point in time was rather cold and thanked his brother but with very little emotion. Several questions were running through Wah’ter’s mind right now. None of it was making any sense. The Wavekept would usually be on top of such terror attacks. The city wouldn’t be this susceptible to hellfire raids and whatnot. Now he finds out his sister is the leader of the cult meant to destroy the city with the assistance of some primordial god or demon. Abel and Cain? (Actually, that’s what Wah’ter SHOULD HAVE been thinking, but in reality he was just super tilted and wouldn’t process anything past WTF IS DARREN DOING TO MY CITY FUCK. Perfectly understandable hehehehe)", "-The party make a quick break for it when guards begin to approach.", "There is a voice heard in the distance. It isn’t too far away from your position position. “Hey, I see some people over there!”", "Sturn whispers, “Go, I can handle this.”", "The party scamper off into the night.", "The guard sees Sturn on his lonesome leaning against a wall. “Move over citizen! We are... wait you’re-” ", "“They ran over that way,” Sturn says without breaking stride. “Follow me men.” ", "-Party continue to traverse the depths district. There is absolute carnage everywhere. Not quite apocalyptic but there is definitely damage being done. For example, there are some cultists in the distance killing some civilians before a guard leaps from a roof and penetrates him with a trident. Blue and green light from hellfires are being lit. The citizens of Lantanis are screaming; the terror attacks have begun", "The Surface Embassy", "-The party have a hastened discussion on their next steps. It is clear in Wah’ters eyes that he will not leave his people to suffer in this pandemonium. Dig, Gizzard and Ubo pledge their assistance to Wah’ter and they make their way to the closest terror site; that being the market", "-Meanwhile Tim has been tasked with taking Wolyn to the embassy and getting some more information out of her. First of all, Tim wanted to make sure that the people at the embassy were alright (mainly the pirates who refused to leave the city), and second of all, he needed a place where he could safely interrogate Wolyn. ", "-When inside the embassy the first thing that Tim sees is the mounds of corpses of both cultists and pirates throughout the entire building. Even Wolyn, who seems to have been relatively well kept this whole time, shows some surprise at the carnage that has occurred here. Tim doesn’t have to look far to spot the lone survivor, Unit A.B. kneeling by the window that looked out into the open sea past the Great Sea-shield. ", "-Blood-soaked blades were protruding out of her elbows and her usually perfect white hair was now a complete mess. She turns her head around and what Tim sees makes him question his entire philosophy of life- if only for an instant. Her eyes are reddened from weeping, her mouth quivering in fear or... remorse? But the most striking thing about her eyes was their constant flickering between red and blue. Red, blue, red, blue, red, blue. Still, she gets up from the ground and slowly makes her way to the wizard. She doesn’t know whether Tim is a friend or foe at this point. He always looked down on her like some lesser being, chastised her, patronised her. But it wasn’t exactly anger that she was feeling towards Tim, she was more confused and afraid more than anything of what she had done- what she had become.", "-Tim feels no small measure of remorse as Unit A.B. collapses onto her knees in front of the wizard and appears to shut down. Tim wants to help the warforged but has no idea of how to operate on this machine. Even if he wanted to help her he was as helpless as a child when it came to technology. Her fate would be in the hands of the gods now.", "-Tim turns to Wolyn and begins his line of questioning. There was much that the party needed to know and little time to gather all of this information. Wolyn was defiant, however, and refused to budge even an inch. It was becoming increasingly apparent to Tim that no amount of persuasion or threats would get through to this princess of Lantanis. Tim walked up to her and pierced her mind with his detect thoughts spell. On the surface he was surprised to find that there was no anger or hatred towards them, in fact it was almost welcoming. He questioned her on the location of the bomb and was immediately rewarded with this knowledge (at the magical tower of all places, it seemed so obvious in hindsight). ", "-Tim decided to dig deeper, perhaps to get some insight as to the mastermind behind all of this. Was this all some sort of big conspiracy? Wolyn, even when initially captured and questioned by Dig, was adamant that the party was oblivious to the actual happenings in Lantanis and that this was all according to plan. Was Wolyn truly the evil high priestess? Was she there under orders from a corrupt government official or member of the House of Nekadh? Or was this all an elaborate hoax from Wolyn herself? Tim would get none of these questions answered because as soon as contact was made with the deeper surfaces of her mind, a foreign presence lashed out at Tim’s like a whip. It was clear to Tim that she was the puppet of someone strong. Someone in the city.", "-As Wolyn collapsed from exhaustion, Tim needed to make sure that Wolyn was secured. There was no way that they were going to be able to escape while carrying a resisting princess. What he did next he was not proud of. Gathering all of the remaining life force from the dying and the dead in the embassy, he combined their energies with his magic to open up a gap into the pocket plane. He dumped Wolyn inside and closed the portal. She was safe for further questioning, for now. But the feeling of having had used the dead to complete this was very corrupting to Tim. It was almost intoxicating the amount of power that was at his disposal. Barnabus berates Tim for this briefly but even the celestial arm was aware that certain sacrifices had to be made in this dire situation. The wizard quickly rushes to assist the rest of his party at the market", "Market ", "-The market had certainly seen better days. There were of course piles of dead and stalls knocked over, produce scattered all on the floor. This was probably a site of absolute chaos as people clambered over each other to get away from these cultists. Wah’ter is incensed with anger. Unfortunately the party were too late to stop this from happening. Even as they got there, the last remaining cultists had already killed some loose stragglers and were now leagues away. ", "-The party, unwilling to give up, kept their heads high and pushed forward to the magical tower. Tim coincidentally appeared at this time too to confirm that the destination of the bomb was at the magical tower. They now had a very important job to do. ", "THE BOMB", "The Ancient Elven Turrets", "-There are dead everywhere, including the defenders and cultists, pools of blood and a terrible stench not just of rot but also some strange chemical smell from within the magical tower", "-Two cultists are shooting what look like machine gun turrets. They are arcane turrets of ancient elven design that are shooting hundreds of magic missiles at a time. The party now need to advance forward without getting shot at", "-The party are under suppression and would most likely end up dead were it not for Tim’s Wall of Force spell which was forming a dome over the party. They manage to make it to about halfway before Tim feels his power waning, this concentration spells is clearly draining a lot out of him and Barnabus. Gizzard formulates a plan in his mind (keep in mind that he is still holding onto a mermaid). He picks up Ubo, who is initially alarmed as he is lifted off the ground, and throws him into one of the turrets. Ubo instinctively slinks into his shell as he flies through the air like some lethal discus, smashing into the left turret and killing the cultist as well. Gizzard meanwhile dashes towards the other turret while it is distracted with the aerial spectacle and manages to smash the cultist too. ", "-Dig notices that the elven turrets are of the same design as the box that he obtained from the treasure room in the Dark Beast Temple ", "The Wastriliths", "-Party rush inside and up the stairs upon hearing screams. At the top of the tower they see a large ancient elven device covered by a force field and connected by interlocking wires planted at four locations. On top of the Apple of Eden, which looks like that apple of eden off assassins creed lmao, is the elven device previously mentioned. So essentially a bomb has been planted on the apple of eden. The party, especially Wah’ter and Ubo, are fully aware of the catastrophe that would occur if this bomb was to go off. Not only will my next-gen logic-proof water physics get destroyed but so will the citizens of Lantanis unable to breathe. The fanatical cultists may not seem to care that much about this but everyone else definitely would", "-The glowing heart of the city, the Apple of Eden, has several disintegrated bodies surrounding it. They must have tried to stop this bomb as well. Horatio is down and there are only five cultists left here but they will complete a blood sacrifice which summons five strong wastriliths that the party must face.", "-The wastrilith looked like a segmented eel with a powerful tail attached to a clawed humanoid upper body, bulging eyes, and a mouth full of fangs. They were generally very big creatures but could grow into truly immense size. These ones were quite large. They do show slight fear as Wah’ter commits to his abomination transformation once more and leaps into the fray. Wah’ter grabs a trident from the body of a fallen cultist as he advances towards his new victims. The party see Wah’ters demonic form but are no longer naive: to defeat a demon you sometimes must become a demon yourself (said some cringe-worthy anime protagonist somewhere)", "-The battle itself is quite intense. From memory, the most memorable parts of this battle were:", "Tim casting several fireballs and breaking through several layers of ice due to the wall of ice spells he was trapped by. ", "Dig casting electrical spells throughout most of the battle. He inadvertently shows the party that these demons were resistant to lightning spells and even sometimes reflected them back at the user. This doesn’t deter Ubo of course who uses his elemental staff to attack these creatures... with lightning", "Wah’ter, even in his abomination form, is slowly getting whittled down by the wastrilith surrounding him. He had three attacking him at once and was still able to shrug off most attacks as they pounded away at him with claw, trident, teeth and powerful necrotic spells. The party realise that Wah’ter isn’t as powerful as he was when he first transformed- was this because he was holding back power or because this time he was in full control? Regardless of the reason, Wah’ter was eventually going to fall if things didn’t change", "Gizzard continued to hammer away with his new sea-serpent tooth greathammer weapon which he named... something in the lizard tongue which I can’t remember. But the main thing to take from this is that he did this all one handed while lugging around the maimed mermaid. That sounds like a good title for a book doesn’t it? The Maimed Mermaid... anyway Gizzard also tries to grapple with one of these creatures. However, this is quickly duped as he comes to realise that these eel-like demons are as slippery as eels themselves. He cannot get a firm grasp on these elusive creatures and is punished for his efforts", "Eventually they do manage to fell a couple of these creatures and the battle is starting to tip in their favour. Victory is within their sight. Behind them they can hear the soft ticking of the bomb and they know that although time was limited, they were going to make it, they were going to succeed.", "Of course that is until Ubo decides to lose his cool and use his avatar, I mean Fury State. So for some background information because I think during the session we didn’t get to delve into this too much. Ubo learned how to tap into his innate elemental powers after some further training from Master Oogway on the first day that the party arrived in Lantanis. Ubo was already an adept elemental warrior but he was never able to reach his full potential because he initially quit his training to pursue his passions of being a chef. Master Oogway could see the tempest within Ubo and the constant struggle within the tortle for balance. On the outside he was a happy-go-lucky tortle with simple ambitions and a very positive outlook on life. But in the inside was this raging storm of fury- mostly from the constant meme’ing of tortle soup. Therefore when combined with the stress of the beloved Lantanis being blown up, the powerful demonic enemies they were now facing, and the constant pressures of everyday life, Ubo couldn’t take it anymore and he tapped into this power. He became a storm himself.", "He rose into the water-air and strong gusts began to form around him. The wastriliths tried to shoot damaging spells at him but they were quickly diverted around him. Ubo purposely loses control and shoots bolts of electricity (he is too far lost to consider the natural immunity of these demons) off in random directions. He is unable to control where they are going anymore so these bolts were going to go wherever the gods willed them", "Now... keep in mind that the party up to this point had killed off three of these wastriliths and now there were only two left. These two wastriliths were already at death’s door as well. But so were Tim and Dig. Now, the first volley of Ubo’s hits one of these wastriliths ONCE. The next three or four hit Dig straight in the centre of his chest. Dig has resistances to electrical sources of damage thanks to his draconic ancestry. This doesn’t matter because half of a fuckload of damage is still a fuckload of damage. Dig is knocked unconscious", "The second volley of Ubo’s hits the last remaining Wastrilith (somehow the party kills another one while Ubo is going crazy) ONCE again and the next three bolts hits Tim. Tim had just been previously knocked unconscious by the last Wastrilith and is now hanging onto dear life. Now TECHNICALLY, Tim dies at this point because Ubo absolutely annihilates the wizard. For all intents and purposes, Tim should be dead. However, it comes to the attention of the DM that Ubo’s fury state has definitely not been play tested (homebrew) and Tim frankly deserves a better death than this. So you know, we let it slide for this time. But just a reminder for everyone: death is permanent now. Tim was only excused because I fucked up LOL and also cos Kaleb is a bastard ", "The party win the battle but now have to defuse the bomb", "Bomb Defusal", "-The party originally had about ten turns to disarm the bomb but now due to Ubo’s antics they have seven", "-Tim is about to bleed out again but is healed by Dig, who was healed by Gizzard, who also knocked Ubo out, who was then healed by someone else, oh and Wah’ter was also knocked out I’m pretty sure. I think it’s safe to say that the party was in shambles and all of them hanging onto dear life. This was the closest to a party wipe since that time Dardy Singh died to some lunar demons. ", "-The party overload the force fields with magic, this is largely accomplished by Tim and Dig combining their powers together. Horatio would help but the party see that he is dead or unconscious. There is no helping him for the time being.", "-They now have to start working on the bomb. There are several wires that are required to be cut. They piece together that they need to cut the wires sequentially but without disturbing the other wires. In mechanical terms; they needed to pass sleight of hand checks (and initially knowledge checks but I felt bad for them so I assumed that Tim or someone read about ancient elven bomb mechanics during his study) which would get progressively easier as the wires were cut. ", "-The character with the most nimble of hands, the highest dexterity, was Wah’ter. It turns out that Wah’ter had the worst luck out of everyone, failing twice. Every time they failed the timer for the bomb would go down. Wah’ter does succeed in cutting one, as does Tim somehow.", "-Unfortunately due to all the mistakes and time wasting there was now only one chance remaining for them to cut the wire properly and disarm the bomb (DC 10 sleight of hand). It wasn’t looking good at all. Keep in mind that after the first failure Gizzard was already out of there. The bards in the future would sing many things of the party; their bravery, their honour, tenacity, fury, power... but we all know deep down that Gizzard BOOKED IT OUT OF THERE IN A FUCKING JIFFY. No one thinks that Gizzard is a coward by any means, in fact the rest of the party would have ran too but they were not as fast as their lizardman companion. Besides, this bomb was not something that could be outrun. The next cut of the wire would determine their fate. Die as heroes, or live as murder hobos. And guess who had to make the last cut?", "-Mother. Fucking. Ubo.", "-Ubo has a -1 for DEX, the party know they are basically screwed at this point. He goes to cut the wire and the entire room goes silent. He cuts the wire and... 13!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "-I cannot describe the relief on my part that they succeeded and I can only imagine how each of the party members must have been feeling at this point. They were this close to death. I wonder how I would even continue the story without this motley crew of murderers. <333", "The Escape", "-Still, the party can now hear more guards approaching the tower and they know they need to get out of there too. Outside, they rush towards the Neptulon Gate but they can see in the distance that there is a massive blockade of seastone and guards. And the guards seem to be ready to intercept. ", "The captain yells, “As commanded by King Poseidon of Lantanis, Lord Wah’ter you are hereby called to cease and desist. You and your companions have been found guilty of treason, mass-murder and conspiring against the House of Nekadh. Lay down your arms or we will be forced to deal with this matter appropriately.”", "-There are crossbows, spears and harpoons aimed at them and guards are now circling from behind them; things look dire when suddenly they hear a deep bellow. Lachlan runs out and carries the party in his arms and smashes through the barricade and throws them over the wall but is shot down in the process and dies. He sees Wah’ter and smiles. Gizzard, who had been running this whole time is quickly scooped up as well and now the party are heading straight from the ramparts. It seems that Lachlan has also gotten Wah’ters belongings. Lachlan seems to want to say many things to Wah’ter, who he regards very highly but there is no time to waste. ", "-Lachlan Ness only barely reaches the walls before he is shot down by hundreds of arrows and harpoons into his body. He collapses, possibly dead, but not before throwing the entire party over the high walls.", "-Tim and Dig use magic to stabilise their fall and they see Bronyl is outside with several sea horses ready. They immediately saddle up and begin to ride off. Twelve guards appear from behind them ready to chase them down but they are deterred by more spells from the party’s spellcasters as they make their escape. Wah’ter and Ubo big farewell to their home as flames continue to burn. They didn’t get to make it to the Fighter’s Academy, the residential areas, the barracks or the Shellebrity Chef. They hoped that there wasn’t too much damage done. ", "-They also note that the Dragonfly, gymnasians and the imperial fleets are not there anymore. Tim is annoyed at the pirates who stayed, they definitely should have listened. There wasn’t anything more that could be done for them now though. ", "-Oh yeah, Dig cast a waterbreathing spell on everyone thanks to the magic that he learnt from Horatio. Essentially it just means that everyone is able to breathe underwater now so long as Dig is conscious. He was taught so well that he doesn’t need to maintain the spell with his concentration, it became second nature. You can thank me later, Dig. ", "You ride off into the unknown, barely affording a glance back at the destruction behind you, the screams and explosions that are still rattling in your ear. The terror and the screams of the people of Lantanis as chaos continues to erupt like wildfire… ", "As your sea horses gallop off, Bronyl turns back to look at you with immense sadness in his eyes. He clearly wants to say something but cannot. What can he say? ", "The very city that you are trying to save has now exiled you and your friends. You are fugitives trying to save the very same people who have abandoned hopes in you. Now, more than ever, you only have each other as you venture towards the Darkest Reaches and destroy these shrines that give life to the Kraken. You take one more deep breath and resolve yourselves for the future…", "TO BE CONTINUED "]

                    "Text": ["The Eastern March", "You only barely made it out of the fabled city of Lantanis. The sounds of the screaming aquan citizens and the sights and smells of the scorched streets and buildings are still fresh in your memory. You wonder what the people must be thinking of you and your companions, the monsters that you must seem to them. You recall that Lord Wah’ter was supposed to be executed today and yet everyone saw your party escaping with him. Little do they know however, that you fugitives were the very ones responsible for disarming the bomb that would have certainly destroyed Lantanis. It would seem, once more, that your heroic deeds would have to go unthanked for now.", "Two hours have gone by since you’ve escaped the city via seahorse back and as soon as you were clear of Lantanis you informed Bronyl of what you had learnt from the temple. You are now headed due East towards the Darkest Reaches on seahorse back. Thank the gods you didn’t have to walk this way. It is gloomy and the darkness is almost suffocating. But you must persist and destroy these anchors so that you have a chance at defeating the kraken.", "Bronyl has been relatively quiet these past couple of hours as have the rest of you, as you contemplate your journey so far. The triton remarks, “We are going to make a stop at an outpost belonging to the House of Daness. They’re allied to the House of Nekadh but they treat others with such coldness and offer little hospitality that I do wonder sometimes if they aren’t touched by the trench itself. Brother, have you told our companions much about the Darkest Reaches or the House of Daness?”", "“No, not really,” Wah’ter admits. Why would he? The rivaling faction of his own, the House of Nekadh, wasn’t worthy of conversation with surfacers. Though, even Wah’ter had to admit that without them the homeland would be quickly overrun by the corrupted denizens of these perilous depths. The triton prince shrugs. “They are worshippers of the Dark Beast.”", "Dig frowns. “Are you kidding me?”", "“Not like the ones we encountered, Dig. They want to prevent its return.”", "“Right, like your sister Wolyn?”", "The triton forces a friendly smile. “Now look here, Dig, I don’t know-”", "Gizzard interrupts the two with an audible grunt. “Stop. Annoying. Shut up.”", "A short silence follows. The tension between the dragonborn and the triton continues to linger in the air. ", "Bronyl adds, “My corsairs will be at the outpost waiting for us. There are only thirty of us in total but I assure you that they are among the finest warriors in the seas. If there are three of these shrines then it will be best to have my boys along. Not that I doubt your abilities of course.” Ubo pats his sea horse as it begins to show some signs of unease, which Bronyl notices. The triton turns to Gizzard. “I see you have a new hammer there, lizardman.”", "The king of the Arafura swamps replies with an indifferent grunt. “New hammer. Yes. Big.”", "“I see... it looks like the handiwork of Lachlan Ness, the deepsmith. I hope he’s alright.” He gazes to the distance. “An hour of travel to go, my friends. Sit back and let the sea horses do the work, you’ve earnt the rest.”", "-Bronyl talked to each member of the party as he rode alongside them. He updated Ubo on the Shellebrity Chef and what happened to it after the attacks from the Dark Beast cultists. Supposedly the restaurant had been completely burnt down from the hellfire raids but that thankfully, his workers had managed to make it out successfully. Ubo muttered to himself that this was the exact opposite of what he hoped would happen. Was the happy-go-lucky tortle simply saying that, or did he really mean it? If you knew who his workers were, you’d probably go for the latter too. ", "-Bronyl asked Gizzard about how he was feeling since noticeably the lizardman was showing signs of anger or frustration. Gizzard wanted to vent to the triton of his frustrations of being in Lantanis whilst his people were apparently being tortured and enslaved by the lizard wizard and some mystery green woman. However, due to his less than eloquent speech in common, this turned out to be little more than grunts and hisses. Although Bronyl reminded him of his pledge to assist him to retake the swamplands, Gizzard wasn’t all too fussed. He wasn’t impressed with Bronyl at all, citing him as useless. ", "-Bronyl then talked to Dig about what he had observed while they were escaping. Firstly, the allied Imperial fleets and Taylah’s navy had successfully made it out of Lantanis and were safely ‘orbiting’ the city. Dig was happy upon hearing this news. Unfortunately, the next bit of news would cause no small amount of distress to the party:", "-Master Panvon had been captured by the enemy and his location was now unknown", "-Lastly, Bronyl caught up with his younger abomination of a brother.", "Bronyl approaches you Wah’ter at last and he rides alongside you at the same pace. He places a reassuring hand on your shoulder. “They say that through fire, nature is reborn whole. Do not worry about Lantanis, brother, it will persist as it always has. We will persist.”", "Wah’ter nods. It is obvious to Bronyl that he is not completely convinced.", "“I can see it on your face brother, cheer up. I know you’re disappointed in our people and our family for allowing such a thing to happen but I assure you we will get to the bottom of this. Stay strong.” Bronyl retracts his hand and you guys continue to ride along. “By the way, how is your affliction, brother? Have you noticed any more changes?”", "“Not that I am aware of. It all seems quite normal so far. If you can call any of this normal, I mean. Proved quite helpful when we were fighting those Wastriliths in the tower.”", "“Good to hear. It would seem that you have learnt to exhibit slightly better control of your transformation. Ubo on the other hand I worry about.” He looks over to the tortle who seems to be lost in a daydream. “I felt his power from outside the gates. Best to give him a wide berth for now and let him figure things out.” Coincidentally, Ubo’s eyes meet with Bronyl’s for an instant as he says this. “Creepy.”", "As Bronyl and Wah’ter continue to talk, the rest of you start to notice your seahorse acting strangely and erratic. They begin to stop going straight and instead circle around on the spot while bucking.", "-The ability of the party to control their mounts is not great. Dig could not control his beast and ended up crashing into Gizzard, who then in turn collided with Ubo and Tim, creating a domino effect of dismounting. ", "-They needed to investigate what was going on. There was clearly some strange glowing lights coming from behind some rock formations to the north of them. They approached without their mounts, they would bring too much attention after all. Looking below, they also spotted many skeletons of... humans and orcs?", "-Gizzard decided the best course of action for the mermaid was to YEET her into the deep blue. This mermaid had already been maimed, blinded and then suffered head trauma from the bumpy ride as Gizzard bolted out of Lantanis. This was probably a mercy more than anything. ", "Crocodiles and Paladins", "-The party could spot from behind their rock formation an ice cube. It was being transported by a group of kuo-toa, sahuagin and merrow and it was brought promptly into some strange cave structure (which btw also slightly fucked with the water physics because ARGHH REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!) ", "-Barnabus made a point of telling Tim of how he had a bad feeling about this but since Tim wasn’t at the sesh- I mean since Tim was determined with saving his companion, he resolved himself to move foward", "-The question which Bronyl posed to them was how they wanted to approach. At this point the party had not had a proper rest and were still exhausted from their last escapade. The truth was that they didn’t have to investigate this scenario but then 1) they were curious to know what was so important to these corrupted seafolk in this frozen popsicle and 2) this was like legit the only way that I could add Conor’s character to the campaign lmfao", "-Both Wah’ter and Ubo were incredibly messed up from the last battle so Dig decided to polymorph the both of them. The dragonborn initially decided to turn them both into formidable sharks. An absolutely stellar idea. Or at least it would be if you didn’t consider the fact that they could spot some sahuagin in front of them. Gizzard smacked Dig on the back of his head and reminded him that these creatures had the shark telepathy ability. This was a good save- the dragonborn opted for some crocodiles instead. ", "-Bronyl and Tim edged themselves down the right side of the approach while the rest of the party sprung into action. Gizzard leapt onto the nearest kuo-toa and unluckily for the fish, was pounded into fish paste by his mighty hammer. Dig would likewise cast some scorching rays into the unsuspecting enemies below. (Just fyi, we reasoned that the scorching rays were not REALLY fire but actually more like light beams because fucking underwater physics FUCK)", "-Ubo was initially quite helpful to the party in his crocodile form, clamping his strong jaws on the necks of their enemies and submitting them into a death roll- something Gizzard would have enjoyed seeing if he wasn’t already racing on into the cave. However, Wah’ter for some reason could not suppress his newfound reptilian instincts and opted to prove himself as the ‘top croc’ between him and Ubo.", "-Wah’ter managed to hurt Ubo enough to cause him to revert back to his original form. Ubo, although a loyal friend of Wah’ter to be sure, would not abide with this act of treason. Out of anger, which is an emotion the tortle seemed to have been getting much too familiar with recently, he cast a disintegrate spell on the triton prince. Usually this spell is reserved for when you really want to let someone and their mother, father, siblings, cousins and pet dog know that they’re 100% certified fucked. And Wah’ter would have been but thankfully Dig’s polymorphy spell proved just resilient enough to withstand the triton being completely turned to ashes. Let us reiterate; Ubo’s disintegrate spell would have reduced Wah’ter to literal dust if he had done enough damage. ", "-Aside from the near death experience of another party member, the party pushed on together into the cave itself where the iceblock was seen being lowered into a pot of fire (which was covered by a tortle shell resin to keep water out lmao). As the entire party was fighting the ice block was slowly being melted away to reveal a handsome half-orc within! That’s right, this entire scenario was basically some twisted orcish kinder surprise. ", "-The half-orc managed to undo his bindings and escape from the rope tying him to the top of the cave’s ceiling. At this point he was now drifting in the water and still floating into the hot cauldron. Dig had now reached the pot and promptly kicked it over to avoid the half-orc falling into it. The sorcerer then cast the waterbreathing spell taught to him by Horatio onto the stranger. Although Dig was wary of outsiders, it was clear that this man was no ally to his current enemies. He would keep him alive for questioning. ", "-The half-orc himself looked quite handsome. Dishevelled black hair, dark eyes, protruding canines characteristic of his orcish ancestry, pointed ears not too different from the elves, ashen skin and of a solid, muscular build. Even Gizzard had to admire for a bit, but not for too long because he had stumbled upon a room full of treasure and also... a rusalka trying to drown him to death. The half-orc did not have any of his equipment on him and so picked up a trident from the ground of a fallen enemy and went to work on the fishmen in the cave alongside the rest of the party.", "-The rusalka grappled with Gizzard for what seemed like an eternity, even trying to drown the lizardman but to no avail due to the tortle shell resin which he was coated in. Dig, without any way to see in this dim light, cast a maximilian’s earthen fist spell in order to assist his ally- he could just make out the sounds of combat. Unfortunately, he missed and almost ended up crushing the life out of Gizzard instead with this stone hand. Eventually, Wah’ter and Ubo would also arrive at the scene to help taking this creature down. And like that, they inadvertently rescued who would be the newest addition to their party; Ro’nok the Half-Orc Paladin. ", "Ro’Nok", "-The party were wary of this half-orc but introduced themselves to him and asked him of what he knew. He called himself Ro’nok and that the last thing he remembered was fighting a lizardman wizard in the Tarannica icelands in North East Australis. Beyond that he remembered very little. Upon mention of the lizard wizard, Gizzard tried to press for more information. When he received none, the lizardman trudged off in anger towards the treasure to look for some distraction from his inner turmoil. ", "-It was clear that Ro’nok was no enemy of theirs (Dig was still wary however). The half-orc didn’t want to reveal too much to these strangers that he had just met. However, he did reveal that he was a paladin to the orcish god Nat Fyfe. He retrieved his bronze armour and his hammer known as the ‘Fyfer’ from the treasure stash. Gizzard attempted to steal the hammer from the paladin but could not locate it in time, instead swallowing a magical short sword instead because he believed it would help him to absorb the power. The lizardfolk aren’t exactly known for their intelligence...", "-The treasure: 11 Copper180 Silver56 Gold3 Platinum2 set(s) of fine clothes (30 gp)1 lbs. of platinum trade bars (500 gp)1 book of elvish children's stories (25 gp)1 bestiary of common local creatures (25 gp)1 lute (35 gp)1 flute (2 gp)7 turqoise worth 10 gp each2 star rose quartz worth 50 gp eachThis Magic +1 short sword is worked with dense draconic scales and precious metals, and psychically encourages acts of malevolence.", "-So to summarise, they still knew very little of Ro’nok and Ro’nok very little of them. He was a half-orc paladin that was fighting a known enemy before suddenly ending up here in the depths of the Lantanic ocean. Did this man know more than he was letting on? Could he be trusted? This much was clear: any allies were welcome in this struggle against the demons. At least they could be sure that Ro’nok was not a stranger to combat. This man could definitely fight. So with that, the party told him of their quest and without any hesitation, the half-orc agreed to help. Perhaps we will learn more in time.", "The House of Daness ", "Your party continues on the road to this outpost that Bronyl talked about. Meeting this new member seems to have uplifted your spirits somewhat since recent events. It will be good to have another person to watch your backs and besides, this half-orc is a paladin which means at the very least, he will have some healing expertise. Still it’s strange, a half-orc here and especially since some of you have had some terrible experiences with their kind.", "You continue to travel for another hour or so and eventually in the distance, you can just make the outline of a heavily fortified position hidden away under the cover of sand on the seabed. Beacons of bright flames have been lit and placed like lampposts on either side of you, on a pebble pathway that leads to a deepsteel gate which circles the perimeter of this complex. Beyond this gate is what looks like a very grandiose, extravagant mansion constructed of sea coral, sea stone and other such exotic materials. Apart from this piece of art however, there was nothing else but ruin and silence. Countless battles have probably been carried out here and there is the sounds of constant fighting from a huge pit that you can just make out in the distance. The sands are still stained in blood and it’s almost like you can see Death himself taking a stroll here.", "Bronyl is leading your group and looks behind his shoulder. “My friends, we have reached the outpost of the House of Daness. To be frank, I never really liked these guys much but they give my corsairs a place to rest so I can’t complain too much. Don’t expect luxury or service while you’re here either. We are at the mouth of the Darkest Reaches, not the Depths District of Lantanis, so it’s as good as it’s going to get for the time being, I’m afraid.”", "At the front gate you and your party spot an old tortle standing by the front gate. This tortle is dressed in a full black coloured 3 piece suit but because of his protruding shell, the back of the suit sticks out at a strange angle almost like some poorly tailored coattails. Although his skin is a faded green and riddled with age spots, he is sporting a stylish white handlebar moustache and beard, a monocle, as well as a long, wooden cane that he twirls around like some underwater pimp. ", "The tortle strains his aged eyes upon your arrival and he slowly strides up to get a better look. “Is that you, Mr. B?”", "Bronyl smiles. “How could you ever mistake this handsome face for anyone else, Sheldon?”", "The stranger chortles. “It seems that your wit is at sharp as ever boy. No more crusades into that godforsaken hole?”", "Bronyl winks. “Any hole is a goal, my good sir.”", "“What do you mean by… Oh, yes indeed Mr. B!” He strokes his beard matter-of-factly. “Now, why, may I ask, are you here and who is your present company?”", "Bronyl gracefully shrugs. “More crusading business, I’m afraid. Nothing too exciting. These are my latest recruits into them company. I’ll let them introduce themselves.”", "Wa’hter chuckles. Your recruits, brother? Dig isn’t too happy with this. ", "The tortle says, “Yes, please do. My eyesight is not as good as it used to be so if you could describe what you are and look like, that would be mighty helpful.”", "Dig, Gizzard and Tim introduce themselves briefly to the tortle.", "Sheldon stares at you all each in turn, taking his measure of you. With the hand that is not holding the cane, he strokes his long beard and grunts. “Hmm… nice to be acquainted with you all. My name is Sheldon and I am the butler to the House of Daness. You all seem like a very capable bunch. Nice, hardy, folk. Well except for you, human, you seem quite frail in comparison, no offence.”", "Tim remains silent, betraying no emotion. ", "Wah’ter steps forward. “You are speaking to the fourth prince of Lantanis. I have come here on behalf of the House of Nekadh on official business.”", "“Who are you again, sorry?”", "The dragoon is taken aback. “You... you don’t-”", "A small smile creeps onto the tortle’s lips. Of course he knew the prince, but he didn’t want to give him the gratification. “You however,” he points to Ubo, “I would have recognised anywhere. The famous Shellebrity Chef. I am truly honoured.” ", "Wah’ter’s jaw hits the seafloor. “EXCUSE M-”", "Ubo laughs heartily to himself and strolls forward to shake the gentleman’s hand. “Indeed, good sir. Thank you very much.” Ubo turns to look at Wah’ter and flashes him the cheekiest of grins.", "“Ubo, are you seeking to leave the House of Nekadh and join their house instead?” Wah’ter glowers.", "“...No.”", "“You hesitated a bit there, pal.”", "“No I didn’t...”", "Sheldon bows deeply and slowly, then uses his cane to prop himself back up. “It’s strange, today I have met many strange individuals. In fact, just a few hours before you all arrived there was another peculiar group here.”", "Dig and Tim collectively perk up. The sorcerer presses, “Who?” ", "“Well, let me recall.” Sheldon strokes his beard. “One was a particularly boisterous fellow and looked like he had a snout on his face but walking on two legs. Rather hairy too. There were also some more of you humans. One was exceptionally small but wearing armour and carrying a very large pike. There was a woman with a strange conical cap, a one-armed man and another woman with a great pair of… *ahem*. In any case, they were obsessed with this… Vault of the Tritons.”", "The heroes are now slightly more worried than before. Dustin Hoggman and the pirates were probably going to end up in more trouble than what it was worth. Wah'ter is more concerned that Yarrick, that small 'human' child, was out there in the dangerous depths. Wah'ter cannot believe the irresponsibility of surface folk with their young.", "Bronyl asks, “How is Lady Daness, these days? Is she still an old shrew?”", "“Tsk, Tsk. Careful Mr.B. We may be old friends but I am still a very faithful servant.”", "“I apologise Sheldon, it’s been a long road. My companions and I were simply looking to rest for the night.”", "“Well you would be wary from travel, Lantanis is quite a ways. I will inform Lady Daness of your arrival. Now if you please gentlemen, you may hitch your sea horses here and I will stable them for you. Mr.B you can escort your initiates to the guest houses in the meantime.” Sheldon bows his head. “Welcome to the Darkest Reaches, lads.”", "-For a picture, all of the warriors of the House of Danell were in the main building or training near the entrance to the trench. There were also other guest houses where the corsairs were staying. Compared to the mansion of the Danell family the rest of the buildings weren’t pretty but they served their purpose. The House of Danell, being worshippers of the Dark Beast, modelled this outpost in its likeness. The mansion was almost like the shape of a giant squid head, and ‘tentacles’ would coalesce between the buildings and into the side of the trench. The tentacles themselves were hollow so that people could travel in them like tunnels. It was like a network between the different points of this outpost, it must have taken considerable time to build.", "-There was also a market here of sorts, mostly a supply store for the House of Daness garrison. It was heavily overpriced for outsiders though so the party decided it wasn’t necessary for the time being. Demons were one thing but overpriced goods? That was the true evil in all this.", "-Sheldon came in to inform them that Wah’ter was not permitted to sleep in the guest house and had to sleep with the sea horses under command of Lady Daness. Wah’ter waved the butler away and ignored this. It was clear that the Lady of House Daness was simply toying with him and trying to provoke a reaction. She wasn’t going to get one today. The triton requested to visit Julia Gill’Ard Daness but Sheldon informed him that the lady was sick in bed and would have no visitors today. ", "-The party entered their guest house while Bronyl left to speak with the Corsairs. The party now had to find some leads and Bronyl suggested that they interrogate Wolyn. But in order to do so they needed to retrieve Wolyn from the pocket plane. The party discussed with each other what they needed to do. Meanwhile, Ro’nok was observing from the distance. He would lend his hand, as he was obliged to. Due to his faith, he was obligated to help those that helped him, a sort of payback that his god demanded of him. This frustrated the half-orc but as a devout follower he had no choice. The party weren’t aware of this though and so when Ro’nok volunteered to help with opening the pocket portal, they were rather surprised.", "Interrogating Wolyn", "*Warning: incest fan fiction/teenage girl dream cringefest below. Reader discretion advised.*", "Tim is once again asked to open a portal to the pocket plane. Being able to efficiently open the gate between worlds is a magical ability not yet quite within his grasp; even with Barnabus helping. For now, you all must rely on other sources of intense arcane energy. But how?", "The entire party bands together and concentrates their magical powers into the wizard. It doesn’t look like it’s enough, even considering their incredible strength. Ro’nok sighs and steps forward to aid this strange bunch. With the paladin’s aid, it seems there is now sufficient energy to begin the ritual.", "The very fabrics of reality once again tear as you forcefully remove the veil between space and time and peer within the gap. The water here begins to swirl slowly and forming miniature whirlpools. It is difficult for you to fully open the portal this time and a hole barely big enough to fight your hand in appears. You’re about to give up hope when you see a flicker of movement from the other side. It has to be Wolyn. You concentrate on her being and strangely she begins to be pulled towards the rip. You reach in and grab her by the wrist and pull but she is resisting with all her might. ", "This isn’t going to be the easiest tug of war.", "But Gizzard has never lost a tug of war in his life, not when it matters anyway. With an almighty yank from the lizardman, she comes flying through the portal and falls on top of Wah’ter as the portal behind her comes to an abrupt close. She darts around the room, trying to look for an exit but when she realises her predicament starts to chant a spell. ", "Barnabus yells, “She is trying to summon a gate. Stop her!”", "Dig is furious and is about to cast a powerful electrical spell but Wah’ter knocks the dragonborn aside. The two tussle for a short while as they both struggle to get the better of the other. The dragonborn swipes with his claws, narrowly missing Wah’ters face. Wah’ter roars and shoulder charges the sorcerer in return. Gizzard pulls Dig back while Ubo does the same for Wah’ter. Wah’ter pushes his tortle friend aside and rushes to his sister, holding her arms behind her back. ", "She is sweating profusely and it seems as if there is incredible stress being placed on her body for no apparent reason. You didn’t notice before but now that you have a good look at her, you are taken aback. Her eyes have no pupils but are instead completely black like you’re staring at two round pieces of obsidian. She must have shredded and clawed at her own skin because there’s blood and tear marks all over her arms and face. Her mouth is dry and she must have been screaming because as she speaks her throat is parched; her voice sounding as rough as sandpaper.", "She speaks. “Vo'hollom thok voh vo'clean. Glory thok voh leviathan. Poz izh hahsh izh doqterrogate ozh?”", "You do not understand what she is saying but she is clearly not speaking in any language you know. ", "Dig bellows. “She is too dangerous to be left alive! Tell her to shut up now, Wah’ter, or I will make her!”", "Wolyn continues to drone on the same three phrases.", "“That’s it, she’s done.” Dig steps forward and attempts to claw the Lantanis princess. Wah’ter only barely manages to deflect the dragonborn’s blow. ", "“What in the world are you doing, man!” Wah’ter screams.", "Gizzard, Ubo and Tim are unsure of what to do. There is a rift growing here in the party and it has nothing to do with the great trench outside. Ro’nok believes in only one simple truth however. You do not strike a woman. ", "The paladin creeps behind Dig and when in position locks the dragonborn in a tight bear hug. “I don't understand of this, Mr Bickman. But I can't stand by and let you hurt a woman.”", "Dig tries to shake off his grip. “You idiot. Do you even know what she tried to do? She's too dangerous to be let alive.”", "“But we do need her for information,” Tim reasons. ", "Wolyn continues to chant. ", "Usually, Dig is not the most imposing or even the strongest in the party physically. But the anger and frustration has gotten to him. With little effort he hip throws the half-orc to the ground and lays Ro’nok flat on his back. The dragonborn leaps over his body and delivers a swift punch into Wolyn’s gut. This time, Wah’ter is too slow to react. ", "As Wolyn sputters out some more blood, Ro’nok clear his throat and says. “What sort of a man are you?”", "Dig snarls. “This bitch is the one responsible for that whole mess back in Lantanis. Are you seriously just going to pretend none of that happened, Wah’ter? You, out of all people should be the one who understands the situation the most.”", "Wah’ter grits his teeth. “No, this isn’t... this isn’t my sister.”", "“What are you saying, man?”", "“I just... I know.”", "Ro’nok says, “I have a spell that can allow us to understand any language... for a time.”", "Ubo finds his friend’s defiance strange. Wa’hter was always devoted to his family of course, this was plain to see for everyone but even so, this seemed too extreme. The two seemed really close. Perhaps even a bit too close. Ubo didn’t want to think it to be true. Of course he knew the rumours and the scandalous claims made by the public but could they have some ounce of truth to them?", "Ro’nok mutters the spell for language detection and Wolyn’s strange mutterings become known to the party. She turns out to be taunting the party at the same time as worshipping Leviathan. Dig is livid and wants to shut her up but Wah’ter is still convinced that this is not his sister. Not really, anyway.", "Wolyn takes a deep inhalation of air as she comes to. Her breathing is ragged and her eyes are bloodshot, skin cold and clammy and her hair all in a mess. She was beautiful once, but you would never know looking at her now.", "She looks slowly around the room, turning her head to look at you all one by one. “You freed me from that beast’s grasps. Thank…” she begins to cough up blood onto the ground. “Thank you.”", "“Don’t speak. Save your strength.” Wah’ter grips her hand. ", "“No. Tell us everything.” Dig bares his teeth. “This is not up for discussion.”", "Wolyn coughs. “I don’t have much time. There is much I want to tell you, so much I need to tell you. Everything I did, I did for the House of Nekadh. But the city and what happened, that wasn’t me. Something went wrong. I was supposed to just infiltrate the temple, but I swear to you upon the gods, something took my mind.” Wolyn shudders. “You... you believe me don’t you?”", "“Yes,” says Wah’ter without hesitation.", "The rest of the party are silent. ", "Dig takes a step closer to the siblings. “She could be lying.”", "“Yes,” Gizzard agrees. “At temple. She try lie.”", "Wah’ter closes both eyes. “I don’t care. She is telling the truth.” ", "“You’re going to be the death of us, you fool.” Dig turns away. “So be it. If anything happens it will be on your conscience. Not mine.”", "Wolyn continues to speak in her weakened state. “The anchors. When I was possessed, I was forced to send protectors to three shrines out in the deep sea. I can remember two being in the Darkest Reaches.” She gives the location of these two shrines. “You will need to deactivate all three shrines in order to make the kraken vulnerable.” Wolyn slumps closer and closer to the floor and her skin is becoming a very pale blue. With great effort she says, “Can you please give me a moment with Wah’ter please? Alone?”", "There is much argument about this and ultimately only Ubo agrees to step out of the room. As the two talk to each other in hushed whispers, the rest of the party tries to listen in. Ubo likewise betrays his friend’s trust and leans closer to the door with his ear pressed against it.", "She holds Wah’ter’s hand in between her own, they’re trembling. “I don’t want to die, brother.”", "“I know.”", "“There’s something I have to confess to you.”", "Wah’ter smiles. A single tear drop falls onto the ground as he winks back at his sister. “I know.”", "Wolyn manages to force out a chuckle through the pain. “No. I mean... the night that I lost control of myself was the night that you arrived in Lantanis. Remember when the entire family was together in the dining room? Someone handed me a vial and made me pour it into your drink. I think… it must have triggered your curse. It made you transform that night.”", "“That can’t be true. There's no way. Someone in the family did this? But who could it have been?” Wah’ter eye’s widen. “Sonyt?”", "“It may well be.” Her eyes begin to fade. “Oh Wah'ter, what a mess we made of things. Mother, Sonyt… and now you. I know I haven’t been the best older sister to you and well you know, and well... that is... I'm not good with words so...” With her last vestiges of strength she gently pulls Wah'ters face closer to hers and they share a kiss. Not the one between a brother and sister, but one of longing, of a forbidden truth between them both. ", "Outside, Ubo has a grin from ear to ear. “Awwww”, he mutters to himself. Then realisation strikes. “Eughhhhh...”", "Wolyn pulls away. “I’m proud of the man that you’ve become, you know. You embody the House of Nekadh, the REAL House of Nekadh. So please, Wah’ter,” she grips his hand tightly one last time, “save our family. Save Lantanis.” ", "“You know I will.” Wah'ter declares, “I’m going to make the demons pay. Not only will I kill this Dark Beast, but I'll kill anything that dares to even utters its name. Then when the dust settles and all my enemies of the deep are vanquished, I will destroy every demon that dared to set foot in Thera. I will tear his body asunder and rip his head from his mangled corpse to parade it through the streets of-”", "Dig puts a hand on the triton’s shoulder. “Wah’ter... she’s gone.”", "-It turned out that Bronyl had snuck into the room and witnessed all of this happen. He claimed that he had always had a suspicion but never believed it. He thought it was beautiful, after some thought. The party decided on which of the shrines they wished to visit in the Darkest Reaches and Bronyl left the room to inform the corsairs of their decision (the corsairs would secure the other remaining shrine). ", "-The rest of the party continued to remain silent. Ubo was still outside leaning against the door so when the door swung open as Bronyl departed, he face planted into the room. Ro’nok claimed to Wah’ter that he could use his god’s gifts to bring someone back from death. Wah’ter begged Ro’nok to do so but the paladin’s past time in a mercenary company affected his judgement slightly; a bit of greed crept in. Ro’nok asked for payment of some kind and Wah’ter explained that although right now he had no personal gold to pay him, he would pay it back in the future. Ro’nok looked at the corpse of Wolyn on the ground and his humanity eventually won over his greed. He agreed to use his revivify spell for this stranger. ", "-So with that, Wolyn was revived from the dead. It was a miracle. However, she was no longer the Wolyn that they all knew. She could not speak and could only manage simple movements. She was essentially a vegetable. (think Khal Drogo from GoT or Casca from Berserk) Wah’ter vowed to never let Wolyn out of sight. Dig was not happy with this. This was going to cause more trouble than it was worth. There was now truly a rift forming between the party. ", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

This vast, seemingly-unending landscape is filled with mysteries and curiosities. Difficult to comprehend is the fact that underneath the land of Thera there exists this sophisticated and technologically advanced civilisation beyond even that of the greatest minds on the surface. There are many hardships you are yet to overcome on this journey; like defeating the Dark Apostles, fighting the demonic invasion, closing the inter-planar rifts, retaking Arcabern and in that grim not so distant future, stopping Lucifer once and for all…", "But for now, your immediate objective is rather straightforward. Put a stop to the antediluvian horror known as Leviathan, the Dark Beast, the Kraken. ", "After your interrogation of Wolyn and subsequent revelation of her familial bond with Wah’ter, Bronyl recommends for your party to rest. He has taken Wolyn with him to another room, leaving your party together in this guest house. Tomorrow, you are to set off on your expedition into the Darkest Reaches and will need your wits about you. Unfortunately, the discordant clatter of tridents and ghastly screams combined with the eerily still silence of the stagnant waters are doing you no favours as you pursue some manner of respite. ", "-General mood of party is as expected; Wah’ter is mulling over Wolyn, Ubo is probably choking the chicken, Dig still extremely aggravated at the growing list of traitors (alleged), and the rest are trying to get some shut-eye for the next gruelling day", "You try your best to sleep on the beds that are provided for you in this guest house. For you surface folk, you are pleasantly startled to find that the beds have been made using giant clam shells and as such, their soft fleshy bodies are a welcome comfort. Before long, you all drift into a long, peaceful slumber.", "Except for Wah’ter and Ubo.", "The two of you can hear each other breathing and perhaps you’ve developed some psychokinetic bond because you are aware of each other being wide awake. Gizzard is snoring extremely obnoxiously and grunting even in his sleep. ", "All of a sudden, you hear a tap at the window, like the sound of a small pebble lightly rebounding off the seaglass. ", "You hear, “Psst, outside, brother.” It’s Bronyl’s voice.", "Wah’ter and Ubo calmly exit the guest house through the front door and make their way outside towards the noise. As soon as you step outside you are immediately face to face with Sheldon, who is holding a bright lantern. Inside the lantern is a bioluminescent bug which buzzes around within the glass confines. ", "Sheldon says to Ubo. “Ah, I was just about to ask you good man. I was wondering if you were in the mood for a drink.”", "“Very good sir. There are two other tortles here in this establishment and they are also very big fans of your cooking, Master Ubo. Perhaps you’d like to follow me. As for you, Prince of Nekadh, I believe your brother was calling. He is sitting at the ridge overlooking the Great Trench to your left over there. Good night, Wah’ter.”", "As Ubo leaves with Sheldon towards the mansion, Wah’ter makes his way towards the lone figure sitting by himself on a cliff edge.

The short one here is named Shelley and the tall one is named Shelilah. Girls…”", "“Hello Master Ubo.” Shelley says shyly.", "“H-hello sir.” Shelilah says.", "Ubo says to the camera, “I’m pretty sure this is just Darren trying to play out his fantasies...”", "“Sorry what was that Ubo?” Shelilah asks.", "The shellebrity chef shakes his head. “Nothing.”Sheldon curls his moustache. “These girls are the two top chefs here at the House of Daness and serve food to the soldiers and of course, the illustrious Lady Daness herself. They have studied your cookbooks religiously, my good man.”", "Shelley approaches you and stands a few inches away from your face. “You’re a lot more handsome than I imagined. Strong too.”", "“That I am.” Ubo flashes the cheekiest grin in Atlantis.", "Shelilah shoves her aside. “Master Ubo we’d be honoured if you could teach us something. Maybe your signature dishes? We’d do anything.” ", "Shelley nods enthusiastically. “Yes please! Teach us how to be as good as you!”", "-Ubo tries to teach both of these apprentice chefs some new cooking techniques as well as some of his most hard hitting dishes. His first dish failed spectacularly and the fact that I cannot remember what it was that he cooked proves this. The two apprentice chefs do pretend to be impressed however, as they are standing in the presence of greatness. ", "-In fact, the dish that Ubo does masterfully create is a garden salad. Only a true master chef could toss a salad the way that Ubo managed to. The two fangirls really stroke his ego when they pretend to be in absolute awe of this tortle’s culinary aptitude", "-Throughout his little demo he is asked some extremely difficult cooking questions that only someone with a few michelin stars would likely be comfortable with. Ubo on the other hand... well he falsely claims mustard to be a superior emulsifier to honey and then forgets what cooking confit means (he is self taught).

But I think I”ll be sticking with them for the time being. Sorry to turn you down.”", "“I understand. It was just a mere thought.

Unfortunately, the handful of guards posted outside the deepsteel gates turn them back immediately. Ro’nok gets a little confrontational, allowing his orcish side to slightly get the better of him. As things escalate between one of these triton guards and the half-orc paladin, Dig steps in to defuse the situation. Tim and Ubo observe the scene play out before them. The wizard thinks silently to himself of how even with Saroza and Styx gone, there was still so much murder-hobo-ing and moral bankruptcy. ", "-As they turn to leave the mansion, the guard recognises Ubo as the Shellebrity Chef. Ubo by now has gotten extremely used to the praises and proudly steps forward with his chest pumped out. Ubo announces himself as the great Shellebrity Chef himself, which quickly prompts the guard to reveal that his daughter had attended the restaurant in Lantanis and received food poisoning. Ubo now retracts his previous claims and says that he probably has the wrong guy. The guard steps up to confront Ubo. Ubo reverts to his survival instincts and retracts into his shell, then uses centrifugal force to roll away at great speeds. The guard as well as the party chase after Ubo and the guard eventually gives in to the break (turtle) neck speeds being achieved by this man.", "-They decide to have a look at the other guest houses and arrive at one of the shelters allocated for Bronyl’s corsairs. There are group of them playing cards outside and the party step in to have a little peek. Before they even get close, one of the corsairs spots Ro’nok’s hammer, the Fyfester, and offers him gold to buy it off him. Ro’nok flat out refuses and explains that the weapon has links to his god, Nat Fyfe. The corsair doesn’t seem to give an ass about this and insists, aggressively, to buy the hammer off him with gold that he had found in the darkest reaches. Ro’nok refuses again of course and this prompts the corsair to threaten him with violence. ", "-Ro’nok tries to be the bigger man (Dig and Tim are both quite impressed at this display of maturity not often seen in the rest of the party members) and he walks away but the corsair goes in for a coward punch. Although the rest of the party had been watching up to this point, Tim decided that it was time to intervene. The wizard cast a wall of force, creating a telekinetic barrier in between the back of Ro’nok’s head and the incoming fist. What eventuated was screams of agony as the triton corsair shattered his hand against the magical force field. The triton is utterly shocked at how this is possible. Ro’nok turns around and decides that enough is enough and offers the triton a gamble. They would arm wrestle. If the triton won, he could have the hammer. If Ro’nok won, the triton would forfeit 100 gold pieces. ", "-Although the corsair was obviously cheating against the much stronger half-orc, he could still not prevail against Ro’nok- especially when Ro’nok decides halfway to ask for blessings from his god which easily overpower the triton. The triton retreats with his tail between his legs and hands Ro’nok the pouch of gold he had at his waist. Ro’nok inspects the contents and sees that he has been duped; it is filled with 100 copper. He has the chance to confront the running triton but decides that it is not worth the trouble. He has already established his dominance. ", "-The wanderers return to their lodging. ", "-During the night they feel a presence in the room and either in their dreams or real life, they aren’t sure, they see a fat man dressed in red in the room exclaiming Ho, Ho, Ho and giving each of them a kiss on the forehead. To this day they are unable to explain what they see. Santa gifts them all with an ability point. How festive!", "THE DARKEST REACHES", "Entering the Darkest Reaches", "-The party awakes to knocking on their door from Bronyl. He informs that they are heading out. The party exits the room. Ro’nok is the last to leave the room and he suddenly hears a booming voice in his head (it is authoritative and commanding:", "“Ro’nok… do you hear my call?”", "“Yes I do, my lord.”", "“It is I, your god, Nat Fyfe.”", "“Yeah, I sorta gath-”", "“Ro’nok, why have you forsaken your vows?”", "“How have I broken my vows, oh great one?”", "“You have pledged your life to the tenets of vengeance. Do you still remember the four sacred oaths?”", "“Yes.” Ro’nok frowns. “Kind of.”", "“The company that you travel is unsavoury to the god of vengeance. There be two evildoers by the names of Dig Bickman and Tim of Felbourne. It has become known to me that in the city of Windar, they committed the act of murdering an innocent by the name of Mikel-Gunner Dawnchaser.”", "“I see...”", "“By the oaths that you have sworn by to me, Nat Fyfe, you are honour bound to carry out justice towards these two. They must be punished in my name lest you be stripped of the gifts I have bestowed upon thee. Ro’nok the Half-Orc, your god commands you to carry out my justice. Do you accept?”", "“But Nat Fyfe is there no other way? Maybe if I could just show them-”", "“SILENCE! You WILL do this task for me, do you UNDERSTAND?”", "“I,” Ro’nok closes his eyes, “understand.”", "“Good. Spread my name to the corners of the world and I will continue to bless you with my strength.”", "And with that, the voice disappears and you are alone once more, but feel strangely cold.", "-Ro’nok meets up with the rest of these layabouts and explains to them the situation. He asks Tim and Dig if they are in fact murderers. Of course, the both of them deny this at first somewhat, citing their reasoning and logic. Ubo barely remembers that they even killed the king of Windar while Gizzard and Wah’ter silently watch this play out. Dig and Tim are worried that there will be bloodshed within the group. They don’t know this half-orc that well and with the knowledge that they have about the gods from the Ancient One, they are slightly skeptical of Ro’nok even being able to speak with this god in the first place. Nevertheless, the two spellcasters stand their ground. Ro’nok tries to come to some sort of middle ground and asks the two of them t o simply bow down to Nat Fyfe and repent. Tim declines this and says that he would be unable to follow an orcish god while Dig seems rather adamant on becoming a follower of Bahamut- he was not some blaspheming traitor. ", "-They argue for several minutes but eventually Ro’nok relents, unable to convince the two to convert and unable to carry out an execution of his newfound allies. As the party turns away to continue to the Great Trench, Ro’nok feels his own powers sapping away from him. The light has left his body and he quickly realises that his god has taken away his paladin powers. He is now a glorified knight. Ro’nok is saddened by this but continues on, hoping that he can still win the favour of his god somehow. Would he really have to kill Tim and Dig?", "-Now outside the great trench, they look at the scenery. As the name suggests it really does look like a great big hole in the ground that seems to suck in all the life out of the water. It is like a gaping void. Wah’ter insists that they take Wolyn along despite much backlash from Dig. Wah’ters wins out and takes his sister with them. He doesn’t trust the House of Daness to be a safe haven for his touched-in-the-head sibling. ", "-Bronyl hands them each a mask that will help filter the poisonous waters of the Darkest Reaches and carries one Sublight Fly Torch (an underwater firefly that lights the way). Asks them if they have any other sources of light. Gizzard decides to use his hammer which has radiant power lighting through it when it strikes something. He will be whacking it into the palm of his hand to generate sparks of light. Ubo would cast some light spells along the way as they travel as flares where necessary. Dig would generate electrical energy in his palm and manipulate the light. Tim would use his trusty hellfire lantern that he acquired back in the very start of the adventure. Ro’nok unfortunately, having lost his divine powers, would have to piggyback off another one of his adventuring buddies. ", "Bronyl leads you all to the back of the outpost where your sea horses have been hitched by Sheldon. There is nobody to see you off and the corsairs have all departed ahead of time to the other shrine. Bronyl saddles up his seahorse and cleans his sword one last time before he mounts. He points to your next destination, a large chasm in the earth ahead. It is a gargantuan hole in the ground probably thirty metres wide and thirty metres across at least. It’s like a vacuum sucking in all of the surrounding water and life into its gaping maw. ", "Barnabus whispers to you, Tim. “The energies seeping from there remind me a bit of hell to be honest with you pal. I would be more than glad to turn the other way and I really wouldn’t judge and I don’t think anyone else would call you a coward either and I mean everything from here on out is unknown and I know that we usually don’t ever know what lies ahead but it would be nice to have an idea except we don’t have an idea so really I just want to say let’s turn around please, Tim…”", "Gizzard snaps. “Shut up! Book! Nghhhh.”", "Tim calms the babbling book down. “We’ve been through worse, Barnabus. We can do this.”", "Bronyl rides forward as you mount up on your seahorses. “Are you all ready to embark into the Great Trench? There is no turning back once we descend into the pit of darkness. Have you all that you need?”", "Dig turns to check on his companions. “We’re ready,” he says cooly. ", "“Then we march.”", "You ride forward into the void. You ride forward into the Darkest Reaches.", "Navigating in the Dark ", "You feel as if you have been sinking downwards for the past hour or two. You aren’t even certain if you really are going downwards or are just floating perpetually in this space. It’s unsettling in the blackness where your only sources of light are the hellfire lantern attached to Tim’s waist and the Sublight Fly hovering close to Bronyl’s masked face. Gizzard is busy smacking his hammer and generating brief sparks and Ubo continues to drop small flares using magic. Ro’nok sticks close to Dig Bickman as they drift endlessly.", "Legend has it that the reason for the trench is a result of the cataclysm where the breach to the plane of water opened- one of the Dark Beast’s mighty tentacles came through and smashed into the seafloor, creating the Darkest Reaches and spawning the corrupted creatures within. Many who have dared to venture into this great trench have returned mad from the constant ambient groans of ancient beasts and the inability to gather your bearings. To make matters worse, the sea floor and walls are devoid of flora, just small and large holes littering the landscape from which mutated monsters emerge. You are thankful that you are travelling with a veteran, Bronyl, who reassures you that you are on the right path.", "Until another hour passes and Bronyl stops in his tracks. “My friends. I am lost.”", "Gizzard grumbles, “Useless. Again.”", "The triton ignores this. “According to Wolyn we should be close to a shrine. I expected some changes in rock formations or perhaps a shift in current or SOMETHING, but I’ve got NOTHING. Sukan!” ", "Actually when you think about it, you’re also pissed. This isn’t fair. Why should you have to do all of this for Thera? Why can’t someone else do it! Why is everyone here so incompetent!", "When you REALLY think about it. Why are you even down here? This is all your friend’s fault? Are they even your friends? This is a waste of time and effort. There is a war above ground and you’re swimming around aimlessly! ", "-Everyone in the party succumbs to a blind rage except for Gizzard and Wah’ter. However, Gizzard seeing everyone in a fit of anger, decides to also be angry as well. Wah’ter backs away slowly while holding onto Wah’ter. Bronyl is moving towards Wah’ter with a snarl. It seems Wah’ter and Wolyn would be the only ones unaffected by this sudden bloodlust.", "-Ubo decides that he has had enough of Gizzard using a tortle shell as a shield and confronts the lizardman about it. Gizzard becomes increasingly agitated and shoves the tortle aside and before long the two engage in a shoving and pushing match. Ubo manages to somehow take the shield from Gizzard and push the monstrous man aside. Ubo grasps the shield firmly between his two hands and the the two lock eyes. Gizzard shakes his head slowly, trying to dissuade the tortle. But to no avail. Ubo unleashes a powerful shocking blast and completely disfigures the shell, rendering it useless as a shield. Gizzard roars and two collide into one another, tussling about in the dark waters", "-Ro’nok’s eyes are set on Dig and he begins to push Dig around. The half-orc is pissed that he has lost his paladin powers and places some of the blame onto Dig. Ro’nok wasn’t ready to kill Dig before but maybe that would change now. After all, it was partly this dragonborn’s fault that he lost his powers- why didn’t he just submit to his god or why did he even murder an innocent in the first place? Dig and Ro’nok begin to throw wild punches at each other, the dragonborn getting the upper hand at times due to his long dragon claws that manage to swipe and wound Ro’nok slightly.", "-Tim can barely contain his own rage. Witnessing the rest of the party fighting each other does egg him on but it is Barnabus who whispers to Tim about there being a strange haze in the air. The two of them discover that there is indeed a strange haze being transmitted by some red fungus-like growth on the floor beneath them. Tim, still barely suppressing his own wrath, decides to unleash it upon these growths. He sends fireball after fireball onto them, burning away scores of these things. He yells at the other party members to do the same. Ubo and Gizzard ignore him and continue to tussle (Gizzard spitting lethal acid a few times at the tortle and narrowly missing him), Ro’nok is also too incensed to listen to reason, but Dig manages to let go of his anger for the briefest of moments to send shocking electricity onto the fungal floor. And that’s when...", "-What they thought was the floor was actually a crab-like creature of a monstrous size, at least fifteen metres in length for its body. These fungal like growths seemed to be growing out of its back (picture the pokemon parasect essentially but much larger and without the cute anime eyes lol). It comes to attack the party, not with any malicious intent of any sort, but just a sort of natural defensive instinct. It is about to grab Wolyn but Bronyl leaps in the way and instead caught in the embrace of this crab. The monster scuttles away with Bronyl in it’s grasp. Bronyl yells as them to continue the journey and begrudgingly they do so, even despite Wah’ter’s protests. In truth, Dig really wanted to help Bronyl in some way but it was clear that there was no way they’d be able to catch up or even have the fire power to deal with such a creature. ", "-The rest of the party doesn’t care much for Bronyl at this point, especially Gizzard who hadn’t been impressed so far with the triton’s combat abilities (despite all the tales and legends of Bronyl’s skill and bravery).", "-Still, they had to continue onto this shrine somehow. Dig decides to take the lead. But where would he start?", "The Watery Labyrinth ", "You continue to wander another couple of hours in the maze of desperation. The mood in the party has gotten extremely sour and things are looking dire. Wandering in the dark, no hope left, no hope left, it’s all over. We are not going to make it out of here. ", "Snap out of it! No it’s all over what are we going to do? Stop moving I’m tired. No I’m not. Yes I am. Is this what losing your mind is? You need to get to the shrine… and fast.", "-The party had to pass a number of checks in order to get near the shrine according to Wolyn’s unclear instructions. The precise mechanics were as follows:", "a) Nature check 1 to find right path: If fail, gain exhaustion level. If succeed, proceed forward. (darkest reaches 1) b) Charisma check 2 to maintain the will to go on: If fail, gain exhaustion level. If succeed, proceed forward. (darkest reaches 2)c) Survival check 3 to ignore the hunger: If fail, gain exhaustion level. If succeed, proceed forward. (darkest reaches 3)", "-They screw this up several times. Ubo was one exhaustion level away from permanent death and the rest of the party had to go back and forth to retrieve lost members as they all tried to get to the end. Gizzard had a pretty easy ride the whole time, only failing once to find his way. He was waiting for his companions at the checkpoint for the majority of the time. Ro’nok and Dig took turns carrying Ubo from site to site as the tortle lit flares using magic in order to make the journey a little easier. It is interesting to note the tenacity of the half-orc and his selflessness even though he has only been with our heroes for a day and a bit, if even that. ", "After what seems like another eternity, you hear something. A faint hissing noise below you. You think it’s below you, anyway. You edge closer as your seahorses dive deeper and deeper until the hissing becomes slightly more audible. ", "There is a gap in the rock wall underneath you but barely big enough to fit through. If you proceed, you will have to disembark your seahorses.", "The Sea Slug Ambush", "-The party find themselves in a valley of sorts with two raised ridges on either side of them. ", "A perfect place for an ambush but the party are more interested in the several piles of bodies and dead sea slugs on the floor. There are five eviscerated transport sea slugs that are at least fifteen metres long each and piles of dead bodies everywhere (House of Danell and corrupted sea creatures alike)", "-After some investigating they found that all corpses had been from trident wounds and judging from the pattern of death they had to have come from either one person because they were all done in the exact same fashion. Still, they hear the hissing sound and Gizzard, accompanied by Ubo, go to investigate. Underneath one of the piles of bodies they identify the noise and begin to dig into the mound of corpses. Finally at the bottom of the pile they find a triton with his eyes glossed over, clearly dead quite a while now. They turn him over and without warning... BOOM!", "-The bomb goes off and they are ambushed by corrupted seafolk (sahuagin, merrow and kuo-toa) as well as some demonic wastriliths. This was the first time that Ro’nok had ever seen these segmented eel demons and now he didn’t even have his paladin powers to help him. He was now little more than a warrior with a hammer. ", "-The enemies on the cliff are a nuisance and continuously try to harpoon and net the heroes caught in the valley. Somehow the party manages to triumph through sheer brute force and arcane mastery. Halfway during the battle Ro’nok even momentarily is granted his powers back by his god who uncharacteristically shows mercy. After the battle however he is once again stripped when the party members once again refuse to worship Nat Fyfe. ", "-Dig and Ubo were mostly throwing around electrical spells even despite the risk and danger while Gizzard and Ro’nok swam around knocking the corrupted seafolk senseless with their hammers. Wah’ter spent the majority of the battle shielding Wolyn from these creatures and fighting off any would be attackers. The party would notice, with irritation, that Wah’ter was not fighting at this full potential due to the anchor he now had attached to him. Tim on the other hand was busy being a source of arcane missiles that shot out like a gatling cannon. ", "-The last remaining enemy was a sahuagin and Gizzard made sure to especially prolong this enemy’s suffering. He interrogates the sahuagin for more information and the sahuagin points them out to the distance where they can indeed see the slightest spark of light. The sahuagin dies after cursing the heroes.", "-Gizzard is still pissed off about losing his shell shield (it made this battle a lot harder for him too) and forces Ubo to get him a new one from one of the dead soldiers of the House of Daness. Ubo agrees, partly out of guilt for what he had done, but mostly because he couldn’t deal with the lizardman’s constant moaning for any second longer. Unfortunately in his vigour, he comes across another hissing sound. Ubo finds this interesting, he swears this is deja-vu. BOOM!", "-Ubo, only having barely survived the preceding encounter, is rendered unconscious by another ‘cleverly’ hidden bomb by the enemy. The party carry Ubo with them and after some healing from Dig (Ro’nok is unable to use his paladin powers for the time being and so fails to do his one and only job), they travel towards the first shrine.", "The Shrine", "-They get to the shrine in the distance and it essentially looks like some monolithic structure jutting out from the seafloor. Light is emanating from the cracks within its surface and there looks to be several strange inscriptions and glyphs on its black monochrome face. They walk up to it and Wah’ter and Ubo immediately notice that these inscriptions and glyphs are indeed the runic symbols for ancient Aquan. Wah’ter was somewhat studied in ancient Aquan, as was expected for a member of the nobility. He manages to make out what looked like a brief history of Lantanis where tritons and prehistoric humans coexisted. There is even a surprising image where it suggested that mermaids were the offspring between tritons and these ancient humans, could this be true? Was there really more in common between the two races than Wah’ter realised? The last image was then of a war between the two peoples and what led to potentially the tritons locking themselves away from surface civilisation till now.", "-Ubo also tries to decipher these messages but due to his very poor grasp of ancient Aquan, translates some things as new cooking recipes and a manual for swimming techniques.", "-They each go forward and touch the shrine and get different glimpses (I will do Tim and Ro’nok’s in the next session because Tim wasn’t there and this is important, there’ll be a mini retcon lol). ", "-Wah’ter gets a glimpse of the kraken or at least its torso and learns that it is very close to Lantanis. Although its strides are great and slow, it would only be a matter of time before it reached the front gates. They had to work quickly and deactivate these shrines. it is very close to Lantanis, it is making great and slow strides. Then somehow in the vision, the Kraken’s eyes meet with Wah’ter and the prince steps back reeling in horror. ", "-They touch the shrine and what comes out is basically a holographic control panel that is projected in front of them. It shows them also the location of the other shrines, all three. The other shrine in the Darkest Reaches looks to have been deactivated by the corsairs leaving only theirs and another shrine. To Ubo and Wah’ter’s surprise, it seemed that the third shrine was not in the darkest reaches at all but within the Vault of the Tritons which was located in the Grand Reef. ", "-Wah’ter slams on the big button and deactivates this shrine as the entire monolithic structure fades to darkness, its lights being extinguished one by one. Now there was only one shrine to go.", "-Wah’ter and Ubo are aware that there is something known as the EAC (East Australis Current) which will allow them to travel to the Grand Reef in the west within five hours) ", "-All they are left with are themselves as the lights go out one by one, till they stand with each other in the stillness and darkness once more. Nothing except the steady beating of their hearts… for now", "TO BE CONTINUED…"]

Ubo would go and teach some aspiring young tortle chefs the secret of the culinary arts while Wah’ter would visit his brother Bronyl", "Wah’ter walks over towards his brother and before reaching him, Bronyl speaks. “Sit brother,” he pats the ground beside him on the ridge’s edge, “I saved a spot for you.”", "Wah’ter seats himself down. “You called, Bronyl?”", "Bronyl passes a stick of seaweed. “Would you like a hit?”", "The dragoon shakes his head. “I am fine. Besides, how does it even stay alight underwater?”", "He thinks on this a while before shrugging it off. “Some questions are best left unanswered, I reckon.”", "“Right.” ", "For the next several minutes he says not a word. He simply gazes at the great trench below , his countenance unreadable. What is he thinking, Wah’ter wonders? Memories of his youth flood back as he sits beside Bronyl.", "After some time has passed, Bronyl breaks the silence.. “What happened with Wolyn is... unfortunate.”", "“Yes,” Wah’ter frowns upon the memory, “it was.”", "“You know... Baynth and I saw the signs very early on.”", "“Signs?”", "“You used to look up to her when we were children, always saying how strong she was and how kind she was. We couldn’t see it though. She would boss us around even despite being one of the younger of father’s children.”", "“That,” Wah’ter smiles, “does sound like her.”", "Bronyl takes another puff. “One time while we were playing hide-and-seek and, I still remember this to this day, you said that she was the prettiest girl in Lantanis.” Bronyl chuckles to himself. “Times were simpler then weren’t they, Wah’ter?”", "“Yes they were.” Wah’ter shrugs. “But then they weren’t as exciting as now. The things I have seen and experienced have been amazing. This world has so much to offer, much more than what I had imagined back in Lantanis as a child.”", "His older brother comments, “You’ve always loved that adventurer’s life.”", "“Aye. It’s the adventurer’s life for me indeed.”", "“And now here we are. You, a dragoon exile and me, the leader of the famed corsairs of the Darkest Reaches.”", "“Hey...” Wah’ter grimaces. “One of these things is not like the other.”", "Ignoring his brother, Bronyl continues. “What a tale! If only people realised we are just two men caught in the web of fate. Demons, sea monsters, the kraken! Ha! Give me a normal life any day I say!”", "“I did not know you were such a bore,” Wah’ter jests.", "“Mother used to read to us before bed. Do you remember?", "“Yes,” he lies. ", "“I am curious. The company that you keep, I mean the surfacers, what exactly are they to you?”", "Before, Wah’ter would simply call them allies. But now? Were they friends? Companions? What really did they mean to him. Ubo was easy to categorise but these surfacers weren’t like anyone the prince had met.

They are like machinery that aid me in my own agendas.” ", "“You’re not being really honest with yourself, are you?”", "“What makes you say that?”", "“I haven’t seen you smile, like you have been smiling when you are around them, for a long time. You look,” Bronyl lets the word roll of his tongue with some deep thought, “happy”. ", "The dragoon doesn’t reply. He doesn’t need to.", "“But what if the day comes when their interests do not align with that of Lantanis? What if one day you must make the choice between your people and the world?”", "“You know the answer to that already, brother. I am loyal to my people first and foremost. I am Lantanis. I assure you if that day comes then I will dash them aside with ease.”", "“I see.”", "“Why are you asking such a strange question, Bronyl?”", "He laughs uneasily. “You’re right. What am I saying? It’s almost like I’m afraid they’ll slit our throats in the night as we sleep.”", "Wah’ter forces an uneasy laugh.", "“Perhaps I’ve just grown jaded as the years have piled on. It’s just that I have been thinking about the world lately and what it is that drives us as people. Elves, humans, lizardfolk, dragonborn, beastmen, all of us. What motivates us to do what we do? What do you think, brother?”", "“Well I’m no expert but I’d say that we are just creatures of habit. All the other subjective things like good and evil, right and wrong, are personal. I mean we are just all simply trying to live what we feel is a worthy life.” A politician’s response. Wah’ter makes sure not to step on anyone’s toes.", "“Interesting. You are more of a philosopher than I thought.”", "“You jest. ”", "“Do you want to know what I think? I think what drives us is nothing more than selfishness. Altruism, helping others without expecting anything, I don’t think that exists, Wah’ter. You could argue by bringing up the conservation of other animals as an example of selflessness, but we only do this because we’re afraid of being alone in this world. We don’t protect the environment because we care about life but because we don’t want to go extinct ourselves. ”", "“That's a rather selfish way of looking at life, don't you think?”", "“Well I feel as if once you’ve brushed aside all the romanticism, the only thing that drives us, truly drives us, is self-gratification.”", "“I... don’t know what to say brother.”", "Bronyl puts out the seaweed stick and tosses it into the ruins below. “Look at me- I’m starting to sound like those limp dick scholars back in the city!

Before you deactivated this shrine, Tim, Ro’nok and Wah’ter received visions when they placed their hand upon its chiselled surface. ", "Tim’s vision", "Touching the shrine illuminates Tim's mind. Throughout this whole journey he has been having intermittent dreams of the great rift in the Badlands. Piece by piece though he continues to assemble the shards of memory seemingly lost after that night he left Felbourne. Now the picture was clearer.

A swarm of nightmares leap into the fray followed by a fearsome black dragon that blots out the sun and stars as it emerges, spouting flames of vivid green and purple. But what captivates Tim are the two robed figures below the rift. Both are extraordinarily gifted in magic. He can feel it. ", "“What have you done?” One of the robed men screams at the other.

He points to the ground and you see that there is in fact another person, a woman, collapsed on the earth. “All this for her? You have doomed us all!”", "The screaming man casts a disintegrate spell on the other robed figure and reduces him to dust. There is fear overtaking this man’s eyes and as he gazes up at the monsters pouring out of the abyss, he collapses onto his knees and wails.

The shrine helped to patch up some of the gaps in his memory and he now remembers some details. ", "He was fighting a demon horde alongside some soldiers while in the Tarranica Icelands far in East Australis. Soldiers were mounted upon armoured griffons while lumbering war machines rattled unrelenting fire into the hellish host. It was a drawn out and gruelling battle with both sides suffering heavy losses. ", "Somehow he ended up on a hill face to face with a lizardman warlock. Taking this evil out could mean victory. Ro'nok was blessed with the power of his god, Nat Fyfe. Using his blessed strength he managed to knock down the evil creature and force it to its knees where it pleaded for its wretched life. As Ro'nok lifted his hammer and praised the god of retribution in anticipation of the final blow, he suddenly felt something sharp strike his chest. Darkness enveloped him as he lay there with an arrow sticking out of his bronze breastplate. But before he succumbed to his wounds, he caught a glimpse of a woman standing over him, another arrow cocked at his head. On her shoulder was perched a giant owl and on her face a countenance of rage. ", "Another half-orc here? ", "The lizardman chanted once more. Then nothing.", "Back to the present", "When Wah’ter touches the shrine he catches a glimpse of the colossal kraken making its way towards the city of Lantanis. The prince estimates that the leviathan will reach its walls within half a day with ease. This is worrying. The party will have to hurry. Luckily both Wah'ter and Ubo know of the existence of the EAC, the East Australis Current. Its exact location is still a mystery to them but at least now it is clear that the heroes will have to head due west of here. ", "-Just to reiterate, they had located and deactivated the first shrine here in the Darkest Reaches. The ‘holographic’ map that was projected in front of them showed the location of the second and third shrines. The second shrine was seen to have been deactivated too- presumably by Bronyl’s corsairs- and it now showed the third shrine. However, this third shrine was located in the West waters in what was known as the Vault of the Tritons", "-Both Ubo and Wah’ter were completely aware that the Vault of the Tritons existed. However, they didn’t know its exact location, only that it was somewhere within the region known as the Grand Reef. This was where the party decided that they would go to next", "-The fastest way to get to the Grand Reef (West of Lantanis) was to travel through the East Australis Current", "-Wolyn was still lost in her own world and Wah’ter was continuing to take it upon himself to look after her wellbeing. The party had made it known several times that she was nothing but a burden but Wah’ter insisted of course.", "Travelling to get to the EAC", "-They headed due West and located their sea horses that they had previously disembarked. They then attempted to locate the EAC itself. They achieved this by following a school of clownfish and that blue dory fish lmfao (two species that Wah’ter stated as being frequenters of the EAC). ", "-The process required finding the trail: Gizzard with all his bravado, announced that he would lead the party. However, he quickly got the party lost in the dark waters. Wah’ter even tried his hand but likewise lost sight of the fish that were their guide.", "-Eventually they would reach a cave like structure where the entrance way was blocked by a boulder. Whilst the fish swam inside through smaller pockets, the party clearly needed to remove this obstacle. Ro’nok flexed his muscles and used all of his might, as well as some divine might from his god, but to no avail. The boulder would not budge. Gizzard, who was already pissed off that he had led the party astray previously, was now fuming because of the weak sight of Ro’nok before him. Gizzard shoved the paladin aside with one arm while pushing the boulder with ease with his other. He glared at the half-orc the entire time.", "-They rode their sea horses inside where beautiful, alluring lights began to tease them to come closer. None of them fall for the bait and Tim notices that the lights are actually coming from a strange species of angler fish. There is a LOT of them. The party make a makeshift bomb using magic and bomb the entire lot of them while they quickly escape through the ensuing chaos. ", "-At the fork in the tunnel the party are faced with a decision. On the left path was a coral maze while on the right was where the fish travelled. They reasoned that the right path would be the logical way to go since the fish wouldn’t willingly put themselves through anything overtly risky. The problem however, was that the right path was also too narrow for their seahorses to get through. The left path was filled with coral which looked obviously dangerous. If you didn’t cut yourself, then who knew what sort of creatures made their nest in there. ", "-In the end, they decided to take the right path and they disembarked from their sea horses. Wah’ter commanded his sea horse to bring news to Lantanis and warn them of the kraken. The dark beast was soon to arrive in Lantanis and they needed to prepare the defences. He was sure that this message would be appreciated even if it was from an exile.", "-Gizzard attempted to communicate to his sea horse to meet him on the other side of the path. Unfortunately, the brutish lizardman failed to get his message across. Unsurprising when considering that he was baring his fangs and making obscene gestures while roaring and bellowing. Gizzard’s sea horse, as well as all the others, were shocked into oblivion and darted off into the distance. Where they ended up only the gods would know.", "-They all made it out to the other side of the tunnel but Wolyn somehow cut her arm from a jagged rock that was jutting from the roof. Wah’ter immediately got to looking at the wound and bandaging it up as well as he could. The rest of his party were unimpressed and otherwise indifferent about her. Dig wanted to be rid of Wolyn. She was a burden as well as a traitor in his eyes. Gizzard yelled at Wolyn to hurry up. Wah’ter yelled back at Gizzard for himself to hurry up and mind his own business.", "The ancient cavern and the EAC", "-They reached an opening in the tunnel to a large cavern. Here they found a Statue to the Drowned God, an old tortle shell on the ground which was subsequently picked up by Gizzard to be later fashioned into a new shield, an old arcane tome that Barnabus wanted to eat but Tim found out it was cursed and dispelled it first, and dead tritons here with trident wounds through them.", "-The party followed the fish down a sphincter-like opening and found themselves exiting the tunnel to their destination", "-There was an archway made of seastone lit up with bright beacons. The archway was an entrance which led to this vortex of water which the aquans in the party instantly recognised as the famed EAC. They had finally made it.", "-Who was going to go in first? Ubo confidently swam forward and beckoned for the rest of the party to enter. Ubo had watched Finding Nemo so he knew what to expect. Then suddenly... they heard a familiar cry.", "The Crab", "-Wolyn was tugging at Wah’ter’s arm desperately trying to warn him of the body hurtling through the water towards them. By the time the prince realised what she was trying to say, Bronyl had already collided with Ubo and knocked him into the EAC.", "-The party turn around to see what had flung Bronyl so powerfully through the water and to their shock, witness the massive Deepcrab (c) beast. This is the one with the red mushrooms on its back that made everybody ANGRY >:(((((", "-If there was any hesitation about jumping into the EAC, there was now none at all. The party quickly rush through the archways to get to their next destination. However, the monster did not let up lightly. It scuttled furiously along the seabed and leapt into the current right behind them.", "-Tim got to work quickly to conjure a force barrier to block it from following them through the EAC which was currently (pun intended) sending them streaming (lmao) through the waters at an incredibly high speed. The massive beast would not be deterred though due to its sheer size and stubbornness. The wall of force did cause it to get knocked out of the EAC itself, but somehow this creature was so powerful that it seemed to be able to keep up with the party from outside the current. The battle would be inevitable now.", "-The giant crab was attacking from all angles with its two giant pincers and strangely enough, a scorpion-like stinger on the other side of the EAC. At the same time, corrupted sea folk were being spawned from egg sacs which it was bearing on its body. Effectively, the party was trapped in a sort of tube with this deepcrab surrounding them on this water slide of carnage. Gizzard, Wah’ter and Ro’nok recognised that they needed to strike the monster outside of the relative safety of the EAC. This wouldn’t be a simple matter though as the extreme differences in water pressure would likely kill any mortal man. Additionally, it would be near impossible to catch up to the party or the deepcrab if they missed their trajectory and shot off into the beyond. Still, they had to do what they had to do.", "-Wah’ter quickly ordered Ubo to take Wolyn and swim ahead to the other side. Ubo complied with this order because Kaleb wasn’t there at the sesh and also because Ubo had no mind of his own and was just an extension of Wah’ter’s will. The two of them swim ahead, leaving the rest of the party to fend for themselves. ", "-Wah’ter began the attack by propelling himself out of the current to latch onto one of the crab’s pincers. Thanks to his dragoon training, this helped him to withstand the water pressure from crushing him as he entered the deep waters. He struck the crab’s pincer with his golden trident, shattering some of the crustacean’s carapace to reveal the fleshy under-layer beneath. As Wah’ter lifted his trident in preparation to deal some serious wreckage to the creature, he paused and noticed another of his companions flying towards him...", "-Ro’nok prayed desperately to his god Nat Fyfe for his powers. He eventually succeeded through his own determination and the mercy of the orcish god of retribution. Now renewed with holy vigour and his natural lust for combat, the half-orc shot out of the EAC ready to assist his party member, Wah’ter. This was where the problem started. Ro’nok, in his overzealous charge, missed the other pincer. This was bad. Very bad. Without anything to hold onto he would surely be left behind. The paladin desperately flailed his arms around to catch a hold of something- absolutely anything. This ‘anything’ happened to be the foot of our very own Wah’ter. Suffice to say, Wah’ter wasn’t overly impressed when Ro’nok collided with him and caused them both to go blasting off again, Team Rocket style. ", "-Both Tim and Dig had it easy compared to the melee combatants in the party. From range they cast barrage after barrage of magic missiles and electricity (highly NOT recommended) and other elemental forces at the Deepcrab. Tim did particularly well with his spamming of Barnabus’ magic missiles which tore through not only the Deepcrab’s stinger but also one of its massive claws. ", "-Gizzard fared a lot better and used his warhammer to crush the crab’s shell. He was a lizardfolk crab cracker and although technically Tim was the one to destroy the appendages, it was really the barbarian that did most of the hard work ;). It should also be noted that Gizzard was extremely unimpressed with Ro’nok’s efforts in the entire battle. ", "-By the time Ro’nok recovered from his first failing, the very one which caused Wah’ter to lose his footing, he was already raring to go once more. After spending some time to cast some divine healing on himself and some of his allies, he went out once more out of the EAC to tackle this beast. Ro’nok leapt for the egg sac that was on the underside of the deepcrab. Gizzard watched in absolute disappointment as the half-orc once again failed to reach the deepcrab’s egg sacs and once again flew off into the nether. ", "-Wah’ter was responsible for getting both Ro’nok and himself back to speed with the rest of the party; a very exhausting effort as I’m sure you can imagine. Wah’ter once again leapt out and managed to get a hold of the deepcrab’s tongue (anatomically disturbing) of all things. Triumphantly, Wah’ter prepared to plunge his trident into the creature. Nothing would stop the dragoon from claiming his glory this time! Well, nothing except the deepcrab, which would chomp down and attempt to devour the triton. ", "-Oh yeah, did I mention that Bronyl was here the whole time? He was definitely a useful NPC ally which the party could count on for the DPS. Another benefit of Bronyl was the fact that he was the one responsible for saving Wah’ter from certain death by the deepcrab eating Wah’ter whole. ", "-The deepcrab is eventually killed by the party by some fancy moves. Dig casts some chain lightning which arcs throughout the deepcrab’s entire body and Wah’ter, who broke free of the creature’s maw, hurled his trident ‘Wanted’ style. The trident curved in an arc before piercing the creature’s brain and returning back to Wah’ter. ", "-Now the party could have a little bit of a breather as they all continued being swept along in this current. They watched as the giant crab disintegrated in the distance and drifted away into nothingness. The party use this time to debrief Bronyl on the state of things but Bronyl was more relieved to see that his dear brother, Wah’ter, was safe and sound. ", "THE GRAND REEF", "Arrival at the Grand Reef", "The party emerge from the East Australis Current a little worse for wear but still standing despite all things; still afloat anyhow. Another seastone archway is here and it is similar to the one at the entrance of the EAC in the Darkest Reaches.Ubo is seen standing alongside Wolyn and he grins upon seeing his companions arrive. He waves enthusiastically to them and chuckles. “Took your time, guys!” ", "No one laughs.", "As they gather themselves and their bearings, they start to notice shadows approaching from the distance. There are probably around thirty of them and judging from their silhouettes, they are all sporting tridents and are well outfitted, swimming straight to their position. ", "The protagonists of our story once again ready themselves for a possible battle. Tim and Dig are ready to bring the house down if need be. The encounter with the Deepcrab was kinder on them than it was the rest of their companions. They look behind them and see that both Wah’ter and Ro’nok are a little worse for wear. Gizzard is either fine or looks as though he is fine, as always.", "Bronyl squints his eyes but unsheathes his sword. He instructs for the rest of the party to do the same. “Let me take a look.” He swims forward and you hear a laugh escape him. “Relax my friends. It seems my corsairs have arrived ahead of time.”", "One of the corsairs is someone the party recognise as the triton who tried to take Ro’nok’s hammer. He strides up to Bronyl and reports, “Sir, we have secured the second shrine and have scouted out the surrounding area.”", "“And what did you find, Merrilus?”", "“One of the towns in the outskirts of the Grand Reef was attacked… by the kraken, sir.”Wah’ter shoots a worrying look to his companions. ", "Gizzard anxiously taps his hammer, still generating flickering instances of light. “Go. Let’s go.”", "Bronyl says, “The Dark Beast is closing on upon us all. I hope you have steeled yourselves.”", "Ubo taps Dig with his shoulder. “More like deepsteeled yourselves, am I right?”Dig rolls his eyes and talks to the reporting corsair. “What other news is there, man?”", "Merrilus snorts. “I do not answer to-”", "“Merrilus...” Bronyl chides. ", "The corsair sighs. “The refugees of that town have ran into a nearby mine called Tio Rinto, owned by the House of Lekh.”", "“That is hardly our concern right now,” Wah’ter says. “Our primary objective is to reach the Vault of the Tritons.”", "“That’s the thing.” Merrilus bites his lip. “The miners at Tio Rinto claim that they have found it, that is, the Vault of the Tritons.”", "-The party had to travel towards this Deepsteel mine called Tio Rinto. They definitely weren’t going to get there in time by swimming so the corsairs offered the party to ride shotgun on their seahorses. Gizzard looked around expecting to see his own mount return but to his annoyance it had not. Wah’ter and Wolyn rode together on a separate seahorse which was provided by another corsair. ", "-As the party rode on towards Tio Rinto, Wah’ter was constantly being pestered by Wolyn. She couldn’t speak as her mind was still a muddled mess but the prince could see in her eyes a sign of... fear? She was clearly trying to tell him something but he couldn’t understand what she was trying to say to him. What was she trying to say?", "The Grand Reef is a stark contrast to the withering waters of the Darkest Reaches. For one, the sea is lit up by great sea bulbs- coral growths characterised by their blue-luminous glow. The ocean is also lit up by the many sea-lanterns carried by trade convoys of slow moving sea slugs, as well as floating convoys led by groups of seahorses. There are large mines and farms to tend, towns and cities of various sizes owned by other prominent houses. Security here is maintained by private companies, usually hired by the different houses personally. ", "Wah’ter takes it upon himself to give the party an extensive and thorough geographical lesson on the area. Bronyl decides to add to this with his insights on the economic history and intricacies of the Grand Reef and its contribution to Lantanis. The party pretends to care, not wanting to be overtly rude to their gracious hosts.", "Still, the news of the kraken being only mere hours away from reaching the great city is not something which the party is particularly thrilled about. They didn’t have time to waste. Deactivating this shrine in the Vault of the Tritons had to be done quickly or they were going to find themselves staring at the ruins of what was once Lantanis. ", "The Deepsteel Mine Tio Rinto", "They reach the Deepsteel Mine known as Tio Rinto. Apparently it is the biggest Deepsteel mine in all of the Grand Reef and one of the primary reasons why the House of Lekh is so powerful- or at least was before Wah’ter slaughtered Gray Lekh at the royal palace. ", "Nevertheless, the site looks very deep and structured with layers upon layers cut away from the sea bed, all for the underground mining of this precious metal. Atop each of these layers rest small encampments for the miners and now, it seems, for the refugees that fled from the kraken’s measured advance.", "The heroes stand at the top of the massive ditch overlooking the pit below. ", "The mining foreman, a rather burly looking merman, approaches them. He looks at the aquans amongst the group. “Prince Wah’ter, Prince Bronyl and Princess Wolyn, many blessings upon you. As well as you, Master Ubo. My name is Theus.” He deeply bows and then turns to the rest of them. “Well met, travellers from the overworld. I hope your stay has been pleasant thus far.” ", "“I am,” Gizzard grunts, “sick of this place.”", "“What exactly is it that you actually do here, man?” Wah’ter asks.", "He is taken aback. “Well I’m the foreman.”", "“Ok. Well mister foreman. Here’s the situation. We are looking for the Vault of the Tritons and there’s an apocalyptic beast at our doorstep so I’ll make it quick. Tell us where the vault is and we will be on our way.”", "“I see.” Theus gestures to the massive pit beside him. “It is true. We have located the Vault of the Tritons while underground mining for Deepsteel. In fact you are not the first ones in.”", "“This is gonna be good,” Ubo smirks.", "“A group of humans and a peculiar hog faced man snuck in a few hours ago. They knocked out all of our armed guards and forced their way inside. The surface folk are a terribly uncivilised bunch. No offence intended, of course.”", "“I’m inclined to agree,” Tim the wizard shrugs.", "Dig mutters, “Sounds an awful lot like some people we know.”", "“We do?” Ro’nok stirs. “There’s so many NPCs in this game Jesus Christ.”", "“Wait, what!” Wah’ter exclaims at the top of his aquan lungs. Even the rest of the party are somewhat startled by his sudden outburst. “You just allowed these guys to walk into the vault, OUR vault?” ", "Theus shifts uneasily from side to side and begins to fidget incessantly. “Look, my prince. It isn’t like-”", "“You are the foreman! What in the Drowned God’s name are you doing? You’re supposed to make sure these things don’t happen.”", "“I can hardly be blamed for-”", "“In the name of King Poseidon of the House of Nekadh, I hereby relieve you of your position.”", "“I don't understand! How is this happening? Sir! My family... I need to work in order to support them. Please... have mercy upon me!”", "“Not my problem, mate.” The Lantanis prince answers coolly. “Now where was that vault found?”", "Theus is defeated but forces himself to respond, as is expected by Lantanis law. Demotion is one thing but the executioner's block is another. “Swim along this trail here all the way to the bottom of the ditch you will get to the mines. Continue deeper for a bit longer and you will reach the entrance to the sacred vault.”", "Wah'ter is satisfied. “Great. Now be on your way.”", "The ex-foreman turns around to leave but chances one more question. “Why is this Vault is so important in stopping the Kraken anyway? Forgive me for my insolence but shouldn’t you, especially the princes, be mustering an armed force right about now instead of hunting for lost treasures?”", "The blue triton turns a shade of red. “If you ask me one more question, gods help me I will smite you down.”", "The rest of the party step in to calm the prince down and the party continue on their way towards the Vault of the Tritons. Theus begrudgingly hangs his cap and leaves for home, now an unemployed father of three.", "-Party swam down, following the trail. This ditch was massive due to the centuries maybe even millennia of digging that had been carried out. On their way towards the bottom they encountered a group of young tortle orphans asking for aid as their parents had been killed in the kraken attack. The party offered what aid they could with food as well as some gold, but there wasn’t much more they could do for the displaced children. ", "-There was then a dying Zoran, the same species as Angel, who was sitting by a cliff face, bleeding out slowly. She was beyond any physical healing for certain as her wound seemed to be of a magical nature, a tentacle-shaped laceration covering her torso from shoulder to hip. The only one in the party capable of performing magical healing was Ro’nok but at this point he was abandoned by Nat Fyfe. Seeing the dying Zoran before him, Ro’nok got to his knees and prayed furiously to the god of retribution, asking for his favour and granting him divine strength. Nat Fyfe took mercy upon his loyal servant, Ro’nok, and promised to return his powers to him on the condition that at the end of the journey, Ro’nok would enact justice upon Dig and Tim. Ro’nok agreed. Would he actually carry this out at the end of the journey? Only time would tell...", "-For now, he healed the Zoran and earned her gratitude. The rest of the party were relieved at this because they were reassured in the fact that their group had a reliable healer. Bronyl volunteered to remain behind with his corsairs to aid the other refugees and help with any other plights. This was necessary because as the party was making their way to the vault, it was clear that there were many citizens in need of assistance. They simply did not have the time to address every single person here so it was decided that Bronyl and his group would stay to assist with the menial tasks.", "VAULT OF THE TRITONS", "The Ultramarine steel door", "-They reached the ground floor and eventually reached the mines. There were deposits on the wall which got richer and richer as they got deeper within the network. The Deepsteel was unrefined, but it still looked like the pure refined material that they saw being worn by all the important higher ups in the city. ", "-They eventually came across two massive doors seemingly carved into the mine itself and is at least 15 metres tall, like it was intended for giants. The door was highly ornate with depictions of tritons in ancient armour, an effigy of the Drowned One, as well as images of winged tritons flying amongst the stars", "-Barnabus noted that the door was made of a metal even stronger than Deepsteel. Ubo and Wah’ter overheard some of the miners dubbing this new recently discovered metal as Ultramarine steel. ", "-However, they also noted that there was a massive gaping hole at the base of the door that looks like someone has blasted through and damaged a lot of the ornamentation and intricate designs. This pissed off Wah’ter extremely and he vowed that he would absolutely tear a new one in Hoggman once they caught up to them. The party didn’t bother to object. Wah’ter was one triggered triton. ", "-Once inside, the door closed behind them and all the water was drained out. Actually this never happened in the session but I realise now that I hate underwater physics and so RETCON- the vault of tritons is like a normal surface environment now hehe umad?", "The Ancient Lift", "-The walls eventually changed in appearance from earth and soil into painted sandstone walls. There were more drawings of the Drowned One and more imagery of tritons and their first arrival in Thera. If the party weren’t so pressed for time they would have analysed these drawings further. This was a treasure trove of history and the learned amongst them were keen to learn a thing or two. They resigned themselves to doing so another time.", "-There were some ancient skeletons here on the ground but also some recent, fresh corpses from none other than the pirate crew themselves. They seemed to have been killed by some spikes, poison and other mechanised traps. Although the party didn’t want to say it, it was clear that they were lucky someone else had bitten the bullet for them. These traps didn’t look altogether too inviting or friendly towards people.", "-They reached a podium with a lone column sticking out from the centre reaching the roof of the cave. A ‘holographic’ control panel materialised before them, just like the one they had seen appear at the first shrine in the Darkest Reaches, and they pressed a button which would send them downwards. Nothing happened. They quickly figured out that there was some strange mechanism involved; there were lines running on the ground into a glass container and gears and pistons, the whole works. It seemed that Wah’ter had to sacrifice some of his own blood to activate the lift. Upon doing so, they were amazed to find that the podium they were standing upon was a mechanical lift. Just how advanced were these ancient tritons?", "The Seven Knightly Virtues", "-There was a tablet on a stand with writing engraved on it in ancient aquan, reading:", "“You have entered the Vault of the Tritons. Treasured relics and our people’s history reside in these strong walls. Only those judged to be worthy by the Drowned God may enter into the treasure vaults. In order to pass you must exhibit the seven virtues of the Holy Tritonic Knight Order” ", "-Wah’ter remembered a rumour that the Dragoons were said to have been derived from the Holy Tritonic Knights. ", "-In the middle of the room was a flat stage with energy emanating from it; an eerie green glow illuminated this room. Seven tritons in heavy ultramarine steel plate each 9 metres tall lined up the sides of the room. Each had an inscription in them and a button. They activated the podium and a hologram of a tritonic knight came out and barred them access to the vault. They had to prove that they were ‘worthy’ and so had to give examples of when they displayed the seven knightly virtues. They were then rewarded and also given a task to do.

Gizzard has even attempted to convert the paladin a couple of times to his own faith. The task that was given to Gizzard was a test of his faith to the extreme. Three poisonous arrows were shot at the lizardman and his only choice was to stand there. If his god was with him then the arrows would simply miss due to divine intervention (or luck mostly). Unfortunately for him, he is hit by all three and suffers some devastating resuslts (max HP lowered by like 30 yikes)", "Nobility Trial: Tim explained that he was nobility as he was the Lord of Felbourne and probably its only citizen. He also had a spot on the Dragon Council which only further legitimised this claim. The task that he was given to prove his nobility was that of relinquishing his titles as proof of his true nobility. As such, Tim of Felbourne gave up his title for good. He would now be known simply as Tim.

This room was like a cavern and was filled to the roof with gold pieces from ancient civilisations, chalices, jewellery, exotic items from faraway lands and other wonders. But to Ubo and Wah’ter’s anger they also found a handful of pirates and Dustin Hoggman trampling around helping themselves to the spoils of their people", "-Wah’ter watched as pirates were gathering up gold into their arms, as much as they could carry. Tim cautioned them against this as he was sure that it could only bring misfortune. He had watched all the Mummy films and knew where this was going. ", "-When the party confronted Captain Isabella and her pirates, they defended themselves by stating the obvious: they were pirates. Wah’ter reminded the party of his pledge and went forward. He was going to kill these pirates and he didn’t have the least bit of care of what treaties and oaths were being broken. He was absoluteley livid.

It looked like a highly advanced box of some sort, with several strange mechanisms and gears on top of it which seemed to lock it up. ", "-Meanwhile, Yarrick was with the amnesiac Mina. The halfling paladin wasn’t helping himself to any of the treasure at all and was more interested in taking care of his ward. Tim could sense that things were going to take a turn for the worse; that is, the bloodshed kind. The wizard urged Yarrick to take Mina and go before the aquan prince caused carnage (he shuddered at the memory of the abomination tearing through Lantanis). But Yarrick was adamant in remaining behind. The halfling reasoned that if he was to leave the pirates, then the party would have no reservations in following through with Wah’ter’s pledge for violence", "-Dustin stopped tending to the relic and turned his attention to Wah’ter, who was now mere metres away from him.

I ought to sever that ugly head off your repugnant body.” ", "Dustin Hoggman edges closer, albeit with measured care. He liked where his head sat, after all. “I know this looks bad.” He gestures to the pirates and the treasure surrounding them, as if unveiling something grand. “But look at all of this.

Dig...”", "The dragonborn sorcerer looks up. “Yes?”", "“Arrest this man.”", "Dig does so without a word and restrains one of Dustin’s arms behind his back. Hoggman doesn’t put up much resistance.

", "“What is this thing you’re so interested in, anyway?” Wah’ter asks, observing the strange cube suspended in the air in the middle of the room. ", "Dustin smirks. “It’s the reason I came here in the first place- to investigate a rumour.”", "“A rumour.” The prince reaches forward to grab the cube. He feels a strange magnetic sensation as the cube seems to almost leap into his hand. It is ancient, that much is obvious. But what exactly is it? Wah’ter juggles it between his hands. “A box?”", "“A celestial arm, oh prince of Lantanis.” ", "“You say it as if I should know what a celestial arm is?”", "Both Dig and Tim’s ears prick up at the mention of the fabled weapons said to be capable of killing gods. Dig possessed the Gauntlets of Malvisier and Tim had his irritating talking book, Barnabus. They recall their old companion Robin also having the Dagger of Time but remembered that Robin was last seen being captured by the turncoat Sir Styx and Yoshimitsu in Windar. ", "Dustin flashes a wide grin at the triton. “Oh, you’re going to love this.”", "-Wah’ter noticed that the box had the same mechanisms as the lift and he once again let out some of his own blood. The box opened and revealed inside a vial with a strange purple liquid inside. Dustin explained that this was actually called the Triton Serum and was a celestial arm passed down amongst the ancient Tritons. It would allow the drinker to have the ability to not only grow in size (up to 15 metres) but would also allow the user to coat themselves in Ultramarine Steel plating, basically a nanosuit of sorts lol. Gizzard wanted to take it for himself but Hoggman made it clear that only those of royal triton blood would be able to use it to their full potential. Trusting Dustin, Wah’ter injected himself with the serum and immediately he felt the power coursing through his veins. He felt in tune with himself and his surroundings, all senses now sharpened. He would now be able to control his abomination transformation and powers at will.", "*Should note here that the reason he is getting such a powerful celestial arm is because I dicked Boyd pretty hard during the gift-giving segment on the Fat Lady pirate ship. He got like some useless Phoenix which burnt him and flew away lmfao", "-They found another door at the end of the vault and they went inside, with the exception of Dig who stayed behind to restrain Dustin. Ubo left Wolyn behind, excited to discover what more hidden secrets could be revealed ahead.", "-Inside, Wah’ter was most shocked of all to find a vat. Inside the vat was none other than who he thought had long since passed- his mother. This seemed to be a life support system of some sort and although he had been only a baby when his mother up and vanished on them, he knew instantly what he was looking at", "-He explained to the rest of the party, with agitation, the situation as best he could. But even he couldn’t believe what was happening. How was this mother still alive? Who would do such a thing? ", "-As if to answer these questions, behind the party appeared... Sonyt?", "Revelations ", "-Sonyt was another exiled prince of Lantanis, the last in line for the throne in terms of succession but was said to have been a mighty warrior and one of the more favoured sons of Poseidon. Poseidon was responsible for personally training Sonyt in the art of war, an honour that only one other, Bronyl, could boast. One night, Sonyt was training alone in hte palace yards when a poisonous eel swum in behind him and began instantly wrapping itself around his neck, administering deadly poisons. Ripping the eel off him in anger, Sonyt only just managed to bring up his sword to block an attack from a masked assassin wielding a silver trident. Sonyt claimed that he had been attacked by Baynth at the time but no one was ever sure. Although Sonyt chased the assassin, he would eventually lose sight of him and instead find himself standing before a floating body, the body of the king’s personal assistant tortle named Joy. This was when the guards arrived. The rest was history.", "-Now standing before them was Sonyt. The party were wary as it was this triton who had apparently been slaughtering people mercilessly and causing a lot of trouble for them. Yet Sonyt had a very calm demeanour and did not have any trace of anger on his face. He was glad, delighted even, to see Wah’ter. Sonyt went forward to hug Wah’ter. Wah’ter was wary and didn’t step forward but waited to see what his younger brother would do. Wah’ter’s heart sank a little when he saw the arms of Sonyt pass through him. Sonyt was dead and had become a ghost.", "-The party have a lot of questions for Sonyt, especially Wah’ter. What was their mother doing in a vat? Where had he been this whole time? Why was he murdering innocent people just to get back at the royal family after being framed? How did he die?", "-Sonyt responded accordingly. Their mother was being used to power the last shrine so turning it off would end her existence; she was being prolonged by this ancient triton life support system against her will. He then claimed that he was not the one responsible for killing the tritons and other such things for the simple fact that he had been dead for a long time. But who killed him? Sonyt’s next reveal caused the whole party to stare in silence. The man responsible for his death was... Bronyl", "-Wah’ter didn’t believe Sonyt, or at least refused to. The party also agreed that this could be a trick from Sonyt. But the more Sonyt talked, the more they were unsure. Sonyt told Wah’ter of a prophecy he had once heard from a blind woman in the market square. Cain and Abel. These two names meant nothing to him but Sonyt insisted that the Cain and Abel in the prophecy had something to do with Wah’ter and Bronyl.", "-Sonyt then went into further detail about his mother’s death. She had come to this shrine with Wah’ter as a baby and Bronyl, who at the time was 51 years of age. There she met with a blue Oni, who the party recognised as Yoshimitsu, and she made a deal with it to rid the curse from Wah’ter. Yoshimitsu was incensed and struck her down, knocking her unconscious but not killing her. Enraged, Bronyl went to attack Yoshimitsu but was swiftly beaten to an inch of his life. Being the cunning and pure evil that Yoshimitsu was, instead of killing Bronyl, controlled Bronyl telepathically and forced him to strangle his mother to death. Bronyl could only watch in horror as his body moved of its own accord. He was a prisoner in his own mind. ", "-Yoshimitsu then tried to make Bronyl kill Wah’ter. However, when he approached his little baby brother there who was on the ground, something stopped him. Wah’ter was so innocent, so pure. The little triton baby was giggling, blissfully unaware of the evil around it. Bronyl couldn’t bear to bring his blade down on his baby brother and so through sheer force of will, broke free of Yoshimitsu and his control. Yoshimitsu cackled and instead tortured Bronyl’s mind, sending him into a 1000 years of torture in his own pocket plane. There, Bronyl was subjected to the horrors of the universe, watching the evils across hundreds of different planes over a millennia. By the time 1000 years had passed in this pocket plane and Bronyl returned to Thera, only an hour had passed. However, Bronyl from this point, was a changed man and a broken one at that. Yoshimitsu was also now nowhere to be seen but the Oni himself had planted the seeds of evil in the triton’s heart which would spur the dark changes in him. ", "-Bronyl then spent the next years of his life further experiencing the evils of mankind. His first ever human friend that he met on his short visit to the surface was killed by bandits. He spent decades traversing the Darkest Reaches, every day a struggle between life and death as he struggled to rid Lantanis of these corrupted creatures, all the while being driven mad by the Darkest Reaches itself. The darkness that overtook the Great Trench would soon also overcome his own mind, which was already battered in the first place. It wasn’t long before he converted to secretly worship of the Dark Beast.", "-This overload of information was like a slap to the face for the party. The story was so preposterous that it didn’t seem to be a lie, which meant that Sonyt was most likely telling the truth. What’s more, Sonyt revealed that when he himself investigated the truth, he found himself here at the shrine. This was when Bronyl stabbed him from behind. ", "-Wah’ter was still shocked at seeing his mother. She was mortally wounded and only kept alive through instrumentation. She was suffering. Wah’ter wanted to power down the shrine and end this prolonged torture but this was when Sonyt revealed the grimmest of truths. These shrines weren’t actually there to enhance the kraken, but in fact to prevent the kraken from entering Lantanis in the first place. As in, by deactivating all of the shrines, they would tear down the wards that were holding the kraken at bay. How was this possible? Wolyn was the one who told them this grand plan! Who was responsible for leading the party astray...", "-Bronyl of course. ", "-The party heard a shout from the other room and quickly retreated back into the main treasure room where they witnessed Bronyl and his corsairs. The corsairs had their knives firmly planted against the necks of the pirates and the other allies while Bronyl himself held Wolyn hostage. There was no denying the mastermind now.", "-Bronyl explained his motives and everything that he had done up to this point. He claimed to be responsible for poisoning Lord Wah’ter to initiate his transformation and induce terror in the populace. He was the one that convinced his father, the King, to send Wolyn to ‘infiltrate’ the cult of the Dark Beast. He was the one who then took over Wolyn’s mind through dark powers and gave the false information to the party about the purpose of the shrines. He killed anyone that ever got close to the truth, including Sonyt. He disguised all the murders and framed Sonyt as well. It was all him. ALL HIM. ", "Cain and Abel", "-But Wah’ter couldn’t understand why his brother would do such a thing? Why was Bronyl so lost? Bronyl reasoned to Wah’ter that the mortal races were a virus to the world, and that there was only pain. By unleashing the Dark Beast upon the world then they could all be ‘reborn anew’ and live in a pure world. It was clear that Bronyl had gone mad. This saddened Wah’ter to no end. How long had his brother lost his mind? Poor Bronyl...", "-Bronyl gave Wah’ter an ultimatum. Deactivate the shrine (killing his mother in the process as well as allowing the kraken to enter Lantanis) or Wolyn dies (has a sword to her throat). Wah’ter’s feelings of pity quickly turned into rage. He couldn’t forgive Bronyl for what he had done. He was a true traitor to the House of Nekadh and to Lantanis. However, Bronyl kept insisting that his love for Wah’ter was true; that even though he hated this world and its people he would never harm Wah’ter. Bronyl truly wished for Wah’ter to see his side and join him. This was probably the only redeeming quality left in this broken shell of a man. ", "-Meanwhile, Tim paid careful attention to where Yarrick and Mina were being held hostage. He only had one chance at saving their lives. He knew that he wouldn’t be able to save everyone so he had to make a snap decision and prioritise. He readied up a fireball spell and prepared to ward as many of the people in the vicinity with his evocation control.", "-Wah’ter snarled and said aloud that he would deactivate the shrine. He couldn’t bear to lose Wolyn, the woman he loved. But then doing so he would end up having the destruction of the world on his hands. What was he going to do? His back now turned to Bronyl and the party, he began the slow walk to the shrine control panel. His arms were heavy, the deepsteel plate armour weighed down on his aching body. Sweat was trickling down his forehead onto his eyes so he could barely see. His breathing was ragged, blood pumping furiously through his veins and he was stressed. He closed his eyes, concentrating. He would only have one shot at this.", "-Wah’ter span around with the force of a whirlpool, at the same time lifting his trident and aiming with his free hand. He let out a mighty roar and hurled his trident through the air and past the stunned onlookers. Bronyl’s eyes widened and he went to react but was too late as the trident sliced through the sound barrier and cut the side of his cheek. The sudden jolt of pain caused Bronyl to lose his grip on Wolyn, who quickly darted towards Wah’ter. Tim saw this as the window of opportunity and likewise unleashed his fireball onto the group that were holding a group of pirates, Yarrick and Mina hostage. He couldn’t save all of them, but a handful of them did survive as the corsairs were burnt to a crisp. Meanwhile, the rest of the party quickly unsheathed their weapons and charged the remaining corsairs. Isabella, Rozo, Dig and Dustin had escaped their attackers but the rest of the pirates had their throats slit by the enemy. There was now full chaos as everyone prepared for the bloody battle that was about to ensue. ", "-Wah’ter went to look for his brother. Where did Bronyl vanish to? By the time Wah’ter realised where the Dark Beast fanatic had gone, it was too late. He spun around to see Bronyl had slipped past everyone in the confusion to the shrine control panel. With a triumphant cry and a crazed grin on his face, his elder brother smashed the deactivation button and all went silent. ", "“I CAME HERE FOR THIS!?” Gizzard screams in hopeless frustration, grabbing his war hammer and howling in rage. ", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

                    "Text": ["Flashback of Wah’ter’s childhood ", "Ubo: Origins", "-Here we have a flashback sequence of the two most loveable aquan characters in the party. Ubo first up:", "The Mudfield Flats. ", "By all accounts, it is a peaceful village that stretches on for many, many miles. The village is a social hub where friends exchange stories, do trade. But most of all, it is a village where the highest population of tortles reside in the whole Lantanic ocean. In fact, it was along the shores of the Mudfield Flats where our very own Ubo Blastortle was born. ", "Ubo, you are sitting on the shores and practicing generating a small electrical current between your fingertips. It fizzles out constantly and you can never manage more than a spark. But you keep trying anyway because you’ve always been fascinated by the elements. Now, despite being a young tortle approaching your 40th birthday, you feel like you’re ready to finally move on to the big city, Lantanis itself. You want to join the army. Maybe one of the gravity-defying dragoons with their deadly aerobatics? Maybe enjoy a respectable career in the Wavekept or the Sethon. Or maybe… ", "You lose track of your thoughts once you hear a scream from the direction of the nearby tavern… ", "-Ubo at this point is oblivious to the evils of the world and what joining the army really means. He is a happy tortle and he is quite content here despite the boredom. He is at peace. Little did he know that his life would be spiralled out of control once the DM had a hold of his character", "Wah’ter: Origins", "Wah’ter, you feel the first fist connect with your jaw from a big, fat tortle, followed by several kicks and shoves from the other attackers. It isn’t long before you hit the ground and cover up from the barrage of blows. ", "The tortle then picks you up and shoves you against a wall which makes you wince in pain. You’re bigger than most tritons your age, well built and rather handsome in your opinion. But you’re only forty five years old and by triton standards, you are still a child. So this tortle who is holding you by the cuff of your royal garb not only outmuscles you, but you are outnumbered five to one by these tortles. ", "One of them in the pack taunts you. “Look at mister royalty over here thinking he can just stroll on in to our village.”", "“Spoilt brat,” another hollers, “you think you’re just going to walk around like you own the place?”", "You recoil from the stench of aquan wine, which you’re pretty sure is fermented tortle piss, permeating from the leader as his breath splashes on your face. “What’s wrong you little fancy bastard? Scared?”", "Wah’ter is simply thinking about how to kill this man.", "You think back to what Bronyl told you. He said that he’d be travelling to the tortle village known as the Mudfield Flats to recruit tortles to the Lantanis army. You told him you’d go with him because you wanted to see more of the world outside of your home city. What a mistake that turned out to be. After arriving in the village you headed to the tavern for a drink while your brother went to business and next thing you know, you’re getting beaten up by a group of TORTLES, of all things. How embarrassing.", "You suddenly see another tortle dashing into the alleyway... ", "-Ubo and Wah’ter made eye contact for the first time and it was a match made in heaven. Ubo felt obligated to help out the triton. He also had an inkling of an idea that this damsel in distress was someone rather important, judging by the way he was dressed and his posture. Perhaps this could be his ticket out of here? ", "-In any case, Ubo and Wah’ter get to work dealing with the bullies. They managed to topple over the largest of them and knock him unconscious. They then turned their attention to the rest of the tortle thugs but it was at this point that the four of them started drawing out knives. Wah’ter insisted on continuing the fight but Ubo wasn’t too keen on the idea of dashing into four armed assailants.", "This is bad. There is so much more you both want to do. But it seems that your journey is now at an end. ", "Or that’s what it was looking like until suddenly a black shape appears behind one of the tortles and one by one they fall as this shadow darts to each of them. ", "As the last tortle falls to the ground, you breathe a sigh of relief. To Ubo, there is a triton clad in black deepsteel plate carrying a peculiar weapon that you’ve never seen before. To Wah’ter, you see of course your big brother Bronyl. ", "He looks around at the tortles lying around on the ground. “Don’t worry brother, they are only unconscious. I think I’m starting to like these SWORDS more and more. Anyhow, Wah’ter, it seems I can’t let you out of my sight for more than a small minute.” He puts you in a headlock and laughs heartily.", "“And how do you do there little tortle? My name is Bronyl. What are you called?”", "“My name is Ubo Blastortle!” He says with a little too much enthusiasm. ", "“Well met. I got a glimpse of you fighting alongside my brother there. I’m mightily impressed.”", "“Aw shucks.” Ubo has his arms folded behind his back and is bashfully kicking some sand around on the ground. “It was nothing.”", "“Say,” the older triton muses, “how would you like to join the royal guard?”", "“What?” Wah’ter snaps.", "“What?” Ubo echoes.", "Bronyl smiles. “The pay is very handsome. You won’t regret it.” He says to you, Wah’ter. “And how about you, brother? What do you say?”", "“I didn’t think it was possible to ascend through all the ranks and suddenly become one of the most esteemed fighters in Lantanis. But okay...”", "Bronyl pats Wah’ter on the shoulder. “I’m going to head into the Darkest Reaches tomorrow. There has been news of dark things stirring there. I might be gone for a long time. A very long time. In the meanwhile I want you to behave yourself alright, pal?”", "“Tch.”", "“You’re my little brother. Remember that. I would never hurt you, Wah’ter.”", "-The four remaining tortles in the pack (the big bully was killed by Wah’ter more or less, but we will sweep that under the rug for now), turn out to be none other than the infamous Michaelangelo, Donatello, Raphael, and Leonardo. Here they turned away from their life of crime instead to join Ubo, at his request, to become his apprentice chefs. Ubo was sure that these four would make fine cooks one day in a restaurant that he would one day open up in Lantanis. Now he just needed a name for such a fine establishment...", "VAULT OF THE TRITONS", "Last Chance to Repent", "The pirates’ lifeless bodies lie slack on the ground, crumpling into the earth whilst the remaining corsairs ready into position. They line up at the exit and block your escape route. ", "Thanks to Tim’s quick thinking and Wah’ter’s courage, you’re in better shape than you expected. Both Yarrick and Mina were saved by Tim’s fireball. Dig also managed to secure Isabella, Rozo and Dustin Hoggman in all the chaos. Additionally, Wolyn has managed to get to relative safety behind Ubo and Wah’ter. ", "-Wah’ter was still concerned that Wolyn was going to be targeted out of spite from Bronyl. He didn’t trust him not to aim for the one thing he cared about besides himself. ", "-The party was exceptionally lucky that Tim pulled the fireball out of his ass or they would have been looking at an even bigger host of corsairs. Effectively the party was now caught in a pincer between the rock and a hard place. ", "In the room behind you is where the true danger has emerged. Wah’ter’s older brother, the traitor Bronyl, has deactivated the final shrine and in doing so has allowed the kraken to attack Lantanis.", "He begins to cackle like a man possessed, which might not be too far from the truth. “Yes! Can you see it now my friends? True salvation! It is coming for us all! The Dark Beast will come and cleanse this world of our sins!”", "“He’s mad...” Dig gasps.", "Bronyl is ecstatic. His eyes bulge in excitement as he speaks with a burning fervor. “In about five hours the city of Lantanis shall crumble into the depths! You have lost, Bickman and the Boys! Even if you were to get past me there would be no way for you to reach the city in time. Give up, heroes! You are all lambs for the slaughter! Despair and give in to the inevitable end!”", "“Tired. Monologue-ing. Kill now please.” Gizzard says.", "“Wah’ter my brother… it isn’t too late. Join me! We can be the kings of the new world!”", "“No more words, Bronyl.” Wah’ter immediately makes a beeline for his treacherous sibling. “You are dead to me.”", "“Then there is nothing left to say.” He closes both his eyes and steadies himself. He takes a breath and you notice behind you that his corsairs have begun to advance towards you. Bronyl unsheathes his sword and points its sharp tip at you. “Make your peace.”", "Fight in the Vaults", "-Some things that should be considered as the party engage in this battle. They were already beaten up by the giant deepcrab that they fought while hurtling through the EAC. Only Ubo was fresh.", "-This translated to Tim having almost no spell slots left, Gizzard with no shield (actually that was because of Ubo being a sick bastard), Dig relatively beaten up and Wah’ter grieving over the prospect of having to kill his beloved brother. The most glaring weakness however was Ro’nok, who was now only clothed in a loincloth after surrendering his bronze armour to the ancient tritonic knight order.", "-The battle began with the corsairs hurtling dimeritium grenades towards Tim. Tim was hit with roughly one million of these magical sapping bombs which quickly drained him of his own limited energy stores. Nevertheless Tim managed to dig deep and use what little energy he had left in conjuring fireballs and magic missiles.", "-Dig also used his lightning breath and spells to great effect while slashing at them with his claws. Ubo was situated closest to Dig and any of the corsairs which managed to close the distance to the sorcerer, the tortle quickly dispatched with his long reaching staff. Ubo then cast Cloudkill to impede the progress of the other attackers. This granted the party extra time to regroup and consider their options. Although Gizzard and Ro’nok narrowly missed the toxic fumes by darting out of the way in the nick of time.", "-Gizzard and Ro’nok watched as Wah’ter recklessly charged in the opposite direction towards Bronyl. They wanted to help but they could see the rest of the party slowly being overwhelmed by the corsairs so they rushed in to assist. Despite Ro’nok having no armour of his own, he had no trouble in using his own athleticism and skill to dodge the incoming attacks of his assailants. His hammer of justice rained down on his foes and ground them into a pulp.", "-Likewise, Gizzard reduced his enemy to paste as well. Unfortunately, the corsairs were cunning and well equipped. They used their vorpal blades, these high frequency energy weapons that could cut through almost anything, and shredded the lizardfolk’s armour with ease. Gizzard hadn’t been touched like that in a while. These weapons were no joke.", "-Wah’ter and Bronyl engaged in a one on one duel while the fighting raged on. They exchanged blows one for one. They fought in the air and on ground with lightning fast strikes and expertly timed parries. To gain the upper hand Wah’ter had transformed into his abomination form which was now supplemented by the Triton Serum (celestial arm). His body was now coated in Ultramarine steel plate and near impenetrable. The tide of battle was quickly shifting to the dragoon’s favour.", "-This was when Bronyl revealed the final ace up his sleeve: ", "Bronyl backs up a few steps as one of Wah’ter’s strikes get through his guard. He sways back and forth for a while before you see very his muscles begin to convulse and shake. Wah’ter can taste victory in the air. ", "But Bronyl’s body contorts and rattles violently for a few seconds and all the while he lets out a series of deafening howls which are colored with extreme agony. Around him a fierce gust makes you stagger and you are forced to shield your eyes and avert your gaze. When finally the winds settle, you see before you something which takes away your breath… because Bronyl has transformed into an abomination.", "-When the final corsair is struck down by the rest of the group, they quickly turn their attention to their friend Wah’ter who was still stuck in a brutal melee with Bronyl. Unfortunately as they turned to help one of the corsairs managed to make a blood sacrifice with his dying breath. As his lifeblood seeped into the cracks of the vault, two portals emerged from within and out came dashing groups of Wastriliths. There was a immense group of at least twenty of these demons rushing in from hell into the vault. Tim was too slow to react and overwhelmed as they tore into him. ", "-Seeing this, Ro’nok quickly rushed in to assist the unconscious wizard. His faith and courage granted him his armour as he fought through a handful of these powerful demons. Dig and Gizzard were occupied with the other group of Wastriliths on the other side of the room and fighting desperately to stay alive also. Ro’nok the paladin fought valiantly through the crowd of demons and laid some healing upon the wizard’s broken body before turning to meet his grim end. Soon the wastriliths would tear into the rest of the party and their journey would come to an end.", "-Except that just as they were about to be torn apart, the portals suddenly became like a vacuum and all the demons were sucked into it before closing off in a violent eruption. The party were shocked but not foolish enough to complain. Instead, they turned their attention to Wah’ter and this was when they realised the cause of their salvation.", "-Wah’ter stood with his trident dug deep into the abdomen of Bronyl. Both were heavily scarred and breathing deeply. This was no easy battle for either of them. Not only had they been exchanging blows with their steel, but they had also been mercilessly spitting at other (a lot more brutal than it sounds) for the entirety of their encounter. Wah’ter bid his brother one final goodbye before using his free hand to swipe at the neck of his older brother. ", "-Bronyl’s head was sliced clean off his neck and toppled to the ground beside Wah’ter. The triton’s head and body slowly reverted back to their original forms and everyone fell silent in the vault. There was no cause for celebration, only despair and grief.", "Untimely Rescue", "-Once again, Darren’s NPCs failed to make an impact. Usually they were just ass in combat, but this time they weren’t even there on time.", "-Taylah Swiftwing and her wyvern mount Toothless, Captain Parco Molo of the Imperial Navy and of course a handful of Draconian Knights and Imperial swordsmen arrive at the scene. They came to assist in the battle but obviously the party had already taken care of matters.", "Yarrick goes around to everyone and fills them in on the current situation. You also find Admiral Swiftwing fussing over Dig Bickman like an anxious mother towards her infant. There are some decisions to be made and questions to be answered; mainly what you are going to do with Bronyl and how you are going to address the kraken threat. ", "-Taylah is relieved to see everyone else and greets them. Then comments that she hasn’t seen Ro’nok before. Toothless sniffs Ro’nok and sneezes wyvern snot all over him, which Taylah claims is a sign of approval from the creature. The paladin isn’t too fussed and introduces himself while wiping away all the mucus from his glistening abs. ", "-Taylah then introduced Parco Molo. He was tall, proud, had a crooked nose and was slightly uneasy on the eyes. The captain was wearing a clean looking white waistcoat with gold lace and the insignia of the golden dragon, as well as a feathered cap which reminded Dig of Hugh Myrin. ", "-Taylah explained that although the Dragonfly was supposed to stay on the surface, they became increasingly worried when no news reached their ears of the party’s location. They were luckily contacted by one of King Poseidon’s royal guard who swam to the surface with news that Bickman and the Boys were in the Grand Reef. Apparently the king learnt of this when Gizzard’s seahorse (the one he had spooked earlier) relayed this information to them.", "-Gizzard gave himself a fist bump. He definitely planned this all along.", "-Taylah had dire news for everyone: an army of corrupted seafolk were spotted headed straight for the city. There had to be more than fifty odd thousand. The party agreed that there was no time to waste and they rushed outside of the vault with their allies. Before doing so, Wah’ter took the head of his deceased brother into Tim’s bag of holding where they would present it to the king. ", "-Isabella, Rozo, Mina, Yarrick and Dustin Hoggman followed them outside. Wah’ter was still pissed off that he couldn’t have the heads of these traitors who attempted to raid the tomb. They were on his shit-list permanently. ", "-Outside, the water was now brackish and seems lifeless like in the Darkest Reaches. There were schools of fish lying dead and even the light from the great sea lanterns were barely visible in the murky waters. Captain Parco surmised that the kraken was causing this and the ecosystem was suffering as a result. As to how exactly the creature was able to affect the ocean in such a manner, how it possibly had the power to affect such a vast area, was unknown.", "-Still, one thing was clear. They had a tough task ahead and little time to achieve it. The party stepped onto the deck of the Dragonfly, which had been coated in a tortle resin thanks to the noble sacrifices of some more tortle kind, and thought about how they were going to do the impossible. ", "-Wah’ter simply clasped his hands together, which he didn’t realise had been shaking the entire time. He had just murdered the brother he loved the most. ", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

Ro’nok bravely leads the defence efforts at the East wall even despite the overwhelming odds and giants attacking them.", "-Gizzard and Dig don’t do as flash up top as lunar demons and a freaking dracolich comes out of the kraken’s egg sacs and demolishes their air forces. The sea serpents themselves are dispatched with relative ease as their fleet utilises their heavy weapons effectively. Unfortunately, as soon as the kraken enters the fray, their plans quickly fall apart. Most of the ships are downed by the field of lightning and thunder surrounding the kraken and some of the pirates even go rogue as the kraken psychically attacks them. The battle doesn’t look like it will be won on the surface", "-Suddenly a portal opens and the underwater team that recently triumphed join the fray. Ubo comes flying in like a discus and the rest of the companions jump in to fight the kraken. Tim opens up another portal for Dig to travel through where he valiantly runs into the kraken’s ear and throws the solution ultima in. As the explosion goes off the kraken flings both Ubo and Dig into the air. As they are about to land in the ensuing blast, Dig quickly jumps off but realises that Ubo has tripped and will certainly die. Dig uses a teleportation spell and casts polymorph on the both of them while they run away", "-Everyone rushes into the portal while the creature explodes behind them", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

LANTANIS", "The Aftermath", "It takes a whole day and the effort of the remaining survivors to clean up the devastation in the city as well as the carnage on the water’s surface. Repairs of the city walls have already begun but these likely will take months of effort to redo the damage done. The city and the people are both exhausted and shattered, but amidst the sadness there is a silver lining to all of this.", "They are alive. ", "The heroes are alive. ", "In the face of doom which was the Kraken, Bickman and the Boys triumphed. And this means that the people, although suffering right now, will have a future. They will have a chance in this new world that was made possible through everyone's bravery and heroism. ", "-The party at this point felt glad that they survived and eagerly awaited the celebrations. Most of all, many of them were eager to finally return to Australis and continue the fight. Ubo and Wah’ter knew that their time in Lantanis was quickly coming to an end and decided that they would savour their remaining moments here", "-One day had passed already and the cleaning up and preparations were well underway. The next night, a great feast was planned for all the survivors. It was decided that the marketplace would be the grounds for the festivities.", "-As to the whereabouts of each of our current party members... ", "The Mage Tower", "-Horatio the Second of Oxinium asked Tim for support in the mage tower. Their job was to stabilise the Apple of Eden. Apparently following the battle, the mysterious artefact needed re-calibration. The close proximity of the kraken did strange and peculiar things to it and H2O needed someone with Tim’s talents to rectify it:", "Tim definitely strained himself during the battle with the Kraken, probably more than most in the party. Not only did he aid in the construction of magical coral but he also rained fireballs down upon the invaders and brought down entire sections of dense seastone walls to impede them. ", "A day has passed now and Tim still feels the effects of fatigue, as is Barnabus. Luckily the babbling book is no longer spouting madness after the defeat of the leviathan but remains quieter than usual. ", "Horatio has asked Tim to help him in stabilising the power field surrounding the Apple of Eden. Supposedly the presence of the Kraken somehow began to corrupt the ancient artefact and they needed to purify it and recalibrate it. ", "Horatio sees the weariness on Tim. “I apologise for asking you to help me with this matter so soon. The mages of the city are all exhausted and resting in the barracks. I would have asked your dragonborn friend but he apparently had someone he needed to see.”", "“I suspect I know who.” Tim smiles. Dig deserves some happiness after all that he’s been through.", "“Good. Now if you could just stand a little to the right over there and help me to…”", "Tim follows H2O’s instructions to the letter and the reparations are quickly underway.", "H2O seems somewhat taken aback by the fluency of Tim’s magical skills. “Marvellous. I had heard tales that you were a powerful mage but this… this is something else. Even the most accomplished wizard should not be able to possess as much power as you do in one lifetime. Several lifetimes certainly. Unless…”", "Tim tries to play it off with an indifferent shrug. “I just read a lot of books. Don’t do much else in my spare time.”", "“I see... forget about that. I thank you very much for your assistance. As you know, maintaining the Apple is paramount to our survival.”", "“Of course. It is my pleasure. I wouldn’t want the people suffering the Schrodinger water physics any longer anyway.”", "“There is… one more matter which I wish to discuss with you but you must swear to not divulge this to anyone, not even your travelling companions. Do you understand?”", "-Tim graciously accepted the task in private. What was actually asked of him was to assist in the King’s disappearance later on during the feast. Tim thought this was peculiar. Why was the king going to such lengths to get out of the city and for what purpose? The wizard promised to ask these very same questions to the king when the chance arose.", "Shellebrity Chef ", "-Our favourite tortle Ubo was busy in his own restaurant in the Depths District; the Shellebrity Chef. Supposedly the king had promised to give him an official pardon for his ‘warcrimes’ (i.e. friendly firing last session lol). This was of course on the condition that Ubo cooked most of the food for the feast and at no expense to the people or the royal family. Ubo wasn’t too keen on the idea but decided it was best to hold his tongue and get the job done. Besides, he wasn’t alone because all of the other restaurants in the city were involved in the feast preparations and he wasn’t going to be upstaged by any of them", "-Unfortunately, the state of his kitchen wasn’t helping him at all. He had his usual workers with him: Michaelangelo, Raphael, Donatello and Leonardo. But now he had extra workers in the form of his elemental warrior sensei Master Oogway, and two of the tortle children Squirt and Franklin. ", "-Pots and pans were flying through the air and the majority of his workers were proving completely incompetent. Donatello stood in the corner screaming to himself while Michaelangelo sat in the other corner peeing into a cup to produce more aquan wine- all the while sporting his iconic goofy smile. Ubo wasn’t too happy:", "Ubo doesn’t think he’s seen a more incompetent kitchen staff in his entire professional career. ", "Master Oogway is trying to roll dumplings but accidentally crushes them in his clumsy hands because he’s a tortle and does not have opposable thumbs. “Uh, Ubo it seems I am having some trouble here.”", "The head chef of the Shellebrity Chef wants to tear his hair out. Unfortunately he has no hair on the stumpy head of his. Instead he yells, “GET! OUT! NOW!” ", "“B-b-but Ubo, the dumplings!”", "“OUT!” Ubo shoves his former sensei out of the establishment and slams the door shut behind him. ", "“The dumplings!” Oogway’s voice trails after him.", "Meanwhile, Raphael is trying to flip pancakes but most of them are either ending up on the roof or the ground. Donatello has made triangular pizzas on the account of them being apparently more structurally stable. Michaelangelo is peeing into a bottle and at least getting most into the actual bottle . Leonardo, carrying a platter of sea-chicken, accidentally slips in one of these puddles and everything crashes onto the floor in front of Ubo. ", "The two tortle kids are probably the best in the kitchen right now. Although they are only making finger foods- and eating some of them in the process- they’re doing a relatively good job. ", "As a result, Ubo fires all of his staff save for these two innocent children.", "-Ubo decided on some very simple dishes that were contrary to his usual artistic flair. The reasoning behind this was the logistics of his task. There was no way to create a fine dining experience for the thousands of people who remained in the city, including not only the Lantanis people but also the surfacers. Therefore the main dishes to be served would be soups, simple meats and a nice classic beverage: aquan wine. Now, he just needed to find more tortles to create the alcoholic delicacy.", "-After firing most of his staff and taking on the job himself, he found that the kitchen was actually more efficient and food quality was even higher. That being said, it was clear that the task was too great for only one man and two tortle children. Ubo would venture out into his competitors’ restaurants and leech some workers for himself under the guise that the king demanded it to be so. Well played Ubo.", "Barracks ", "-The rest of the party were in the barracks; Gizzard, Ro’nok, Dig and Wah’ter.", "-The scene was pretty grim. There were just hundreds upon hundreds of wounded soldiers from both the surface and the aquan forces. Most of these people weren’t going to make it and it looked like the nurses were simply trying to ease their pain", "-The suffering from the wounded reminded Gizzard of what his people must be going through. Still, there was little that could be done. Gizzard didn’t feel like vocalising this pain either because Aidan decided not to turn up to the sesh wow loser idiot head", "-There was also a shortage of doctors here and Yarrick was seen busy running around trying to help who he could. He spotted Ro’nok and asked for his assistance. Ro’nok’s first patient/victim was a merman who had his entire lower torso missing. The merman was effectively just a... man. Yarrick suggested to Ro’nok that it was probably over for the poor soldier. Likewise, the merman simply requested for Ro’nok to ease his suffering and allow him to enter into the next life. Ro’nok was stubborn, however. He wanted to do all that he could to heal the man’s pain and for him to continue living. As a result, the merman’s life was sustained- he would most probably last another two years. But his life would be in constant torment and agony. Was this the wisest decision by Ro’nok? Was his compassion too much of an oversight? ", "-The next significant interaction in the barracks was between Dig Bickman and the love of his life, Taylah Swiftwing. Taylah was looking incredibly bruised up but thankfully no significant injuries were sustained. Toothless was here nestling his head in her bosom and upon seeing Dig, seemed to accept the dragonborn as one of its own. Taylah seemed to have some important news for Dig. Ubo also managed to eventually visit the barracks and serve soup to all the wounded. Taylah tried to reach for some at one point but Ubo slapped her hand away. What a bastard:", "“My love. My sssssweet. I have something to tell you.”", "“Oh god,” Bickman said, “I really don’t want to roleplay this Darren.”", "“I am… with child.”", "Wah’ter strolls up to the two as they are having their private conversation. “That’s amazing news!”", "Dig shoots him a quizzical look.", "Taylah looks worriedly at her paramour. “My love?”", "Dig tries to shove the abomination aside. “That is absolutely great news. I’m just... a little shocked. How,” he scratches his head, “did this happen?”", "Wah’ter interjects. “Well, when a man and a woman love each other very much-”", "“Shut up.” ", "Taylah holds Dig’s hands in hers. “I knew you’d be happy. I’ve never felt so happy in my life. I love you, Dig Bickman.”", "Dig replies. “I... love you too. Darren, please stop making me RP this.”", "“But you know what this meansssss don’t you? I want to continue in the fight but it would be at the risk of the baby. I have thought long and hard and I do not know what to do. Before, I had little to fight for.Now… for the first time I’m sssscared. Scared of dying and scared of you falling. What should we do?”", "“The way I see it, there are two options. Either we have you stay in Lantanis where you will be safe or you will go back to Europa and wait until this all dies down. In any case, I will not allow you to set foot on the battlefield while you are with child.”", "“Taylah is not welcome in this city,” says Wah’ter tactlessly.", "“Really?” Dig says.", "Wah’ter laughs. “No, just kidding.” He isn’t kidding.", "“Well,” Dig shrugs, “going back to Europa may be the better choice for you Taylah. It will make me feel better knowing that you are safer in the homeland. I know you probably want to continue to aid in the war effort but right now it’s just too dangerous. Let us handle things from here on out.”", "Taylah looks defeated in a way but she seems to understand the situation. She knows that she will be of little use in the future while she is holding another life within her. “I understand. Right or wrong, I trust you. Give me a few days more rest and I will set out for Europa. It is difficult to give up the fight but... there is little choice.” She props herself up on her bed and hugs the sorcerer. “Dig Bickman, in the name of Emperor Char-Chill and Europa, I name you Admiral of the Dragonfly and charge you to lead our forces for the Empire’s glory.", "Dig freezes, mouth agape and heart racing. “This is an honour. I don’t know what to say.”", "Taylah lets out a sigh. “I won’t keep you too long now, my love. Pleassse send my regards to the rest of your friends. I will pray for your safe journey and hope that the Dragonfly ssssserves you well as it has me. And one last thing. Don’t make your child grow up fatherless or I’ll kill you myself.”", "Dig chuckles and hugs her close to his chest as Toothless licks its paws.", "Wah’ter thinks aloud. “Hang on. That doesn’t make any sense! He’d be dead already so how would you be able to kill him?”", "Ubo rushes in with a platter of soup. “Yeah, what the heck!”", "-As Taylah returned to her slumber, Wah’ter heard the call from a familiar face. Lachlan Ness was beckoning for his bestest friend to come over. The sea giant was resting on teh floor itself because no one could find a bed capable of supporting his weight. Lachlan Ness was ecstatic to see Wah’ter and taps him on the shoulder. Even in Wah’ter’s abomination form, the wind was knocked out of him as Ness’ fist slammed into his side.", "-Seeing the abomination prince safe, Lachlan Ness began to cry. The ground shook from the effort. Then suddenly, their little bromance was interrupted by a voice:", "“Careful big guy. You’ll cause a tsunami.”", "Wah’ter is unsure of who could possibly be addressing them. Nevertheless, he is extremely mindful of his social status as a prince and quickly combs his hair before turning around. As his eyes meet with the mysterious stranger, they begin to well up with tears and he can barely believe what is in front of him right now.", "“Wolyn?”", "The sister of the triton dragoon takes a few steps forward. “Wah’ter, is that really you? You look… different.” ", "Wah’ter has recently decided to stay in the abomination form in perpetuity. For what reasons is only known to himself and possibly Ubo. “B-but how?”", "Still, Wolyn embraces him. She is wearing a beautiful white laced dress that sparkles and oozes elegance and beauty from top to bottom. Especially to Wah’ter, who is now also oozing from top to bottom. “When the Dark Beast fell, it was like some great weight was lifted from my mind. It felt like I was a prisoner in my body, finally set free. It feels so good to be alive, finally.”", "“You definitely feel good.” Wah’ter refuses to let go and clamps onto his sister even tighter.", "“Banyth told me everything. Wah’ter, is Bronyl…?”", "He retracts from the hug and responds, “Look, you see what I am now? It turns out that Bronyl had that too. Nothing could be done for him. He betrayed us so I took care of it.”", "She looks away in sadness. “If only there was another way. I don’t think Bronyl was evil, just lost. Perhaps he was still redeemable even in the end. But… what’s done is done.”", "“What’s done is done.”", "“The important thing is we’ve won. The kraken is defeated and you’re alive. Have you spoken to father yet?”", "“Nope.”", "“Nor have I. I’m sure we will have plenty of opportunity to tonight at the great feast.” She changes the topic. “I’m looking forward to it, especially meeting your friends! You didn’t tell me that you knew all these surfacers! What are they like?”A snigger can be heard from Tim all the way from the mage tower across the city. Wah’ter spends a fair amount of time describing what he hates about the surfacers but his heart, possibly warmed from Sonyt’s presence, spills out eventually. “The Boys are alright. Fucking hate Gizzard though lol.”", "“They can’t be all that bad! They look rather cute actually, especially that green fellow. Maybe I’ll have a little chat with him later tonight?” She winks.", "This does sting Wah’ter’s pride a little.", "Ro’nok, halfway through treating one of the patients, hears this little compliment and decides to see what all the commotion is about. He puffs his chest and brushes off some dust off his shoulders as he strides over to where Wah’ter and Wolyn are standing. ", "The half-orc leans against a wooden post as he introduces himself to Wolyn. “So uh, heard you talking about me just then love. I gotta say, you’ve got the loveliest-”", "“That’s nice, dear,” Wolyn returns, coolly.", "“Uh, right. Um... what was I- oh yeah, maybe later tonight you and I could-”", "“Yes, yes, good for you. Could you, pretty please, move over there or something while I talk to my brother. Thank you very much that would be appreciated.”", "“But-”", "“Anyway, Wah’ter,” Wolyn turns away from a bruised Ro’nok.", "“What a bitch...” Ro’noks voice trails off as he returns to one of the wounded.", "“Just kidding, little brother.” She gives Wah’ter a kiss on the cheek. Wah’ter blushes. Then she says seriously. “I know how you feel about me, Wah’ter. I’ve been thinking about it long even before my amnesia. I love you. Truly you mean so much to me.”", "“You means heaps to me too hey,” Wah’ter echoes.", "“But it just cannot be.”", "“Wait what!”", "“We are brother and sister. It is wrong to love each other the way that we do. It must stop.”", "“But our grandparents were siblings too! It’s normal.”", "“Our father changed that law remember? It’s against the tenets of our peoples. We would be going against tradition.”", "“Man this is some shit...”", "“I am sorry.” She hesitantly stands up and turns to leave the barracks. “I hope you can understand. Perhaps in another lifetime?”", "Wah’ter dramatically turns away. “Perhaps...” ", "She leaves. Wah’ter stares off into the distance dramatically among the sick and dying. ", "Ubo scuttles to his prince. “Soup?” ", "2. The Party", "The Address The entire city has erupted at night. There are sea lanterns of red, blue, green, yellow, purple, all strung along in a line from building to building. The air has been perfumed thanks to a little tinkering by Horatio and it smells like cherry blossoms infused with blueberry. Because of this, the smell of the copious amounts of seaweed currently being smoked by some of the older folk is barely perceptible. The party takes in the sounds of elation and cheering while streamers and underwater light shows take place all around. These are courtesy of the mages who took special pride in ensuring spectacular prestidigitation and tricks. Kids and adults alike dance in the streets while the younger crowd chase each other with toy tridents.", "Soon a procession begins with fanfare and sombre music as the dead are brought out and placed in a mound before everyone. Banyth, Sturn, Aryn, Wolyn and King Poseidon as well as a handful of royal guard lead the procession and step onto a makeshift stage that overlooks the marketplace. Before the festivities begin, the king makes a long speech about the bravery and sacrifices of those that died in the battle for Lantanis. ", "Wah’ter sees the dead being encased in their armour which has been further decorated with colourful coral and beautiful seashells. Rocks have been attached to their heels. Wah’ter remembers the ritual of his people. There is a great pit beside the Royal palace that is said to to houses another ancient being. In effect it is a bottomless pit and nobody knows what lies at the bottom. Some theorise that it is the portal to another plane, the very same that his own people came from. Others still believe in the ancient beast theory and still yet others believe that it is truly a pit with no end. In any event, these people would be transferred back into the earth to sustain life. ", "Even in death they will still serve.", "After this is done. King Poseidon smiles warmly and welcomes each of the party members to the stage. “Citizens of Lantanis. We have celebrated the sacrifices of the departed and their brave deeds. Now let us celebrate the heroes of Lantanis who drove back the darkness and slew the Dark Beast!”", "Each and every one of the party members enters onto the stage save for Gizzard. The lizardfolk is busy brooding over the fate of his peoples. He is quite annoyed at fighting other people’s battles and wonders when it will be his turn to receive the same help in turn.", "Wah’ter recites a speech from a Lord of the Rings movie and replaces some of the words with that of Lantanis. The crowd is none the wiser and they cheer and chant the names of the heroes for several minutes. Some of the party members remember the coronation ceremony for Lux and how similar that feeling of accomplishment was to now. Even though the quest is far from over and there are still so many more foes remaining, they take the time to really take in the praise and revel in the love of the people of Lantanis.Soon, the king leaves the stage. The food cooked from Ubo and his staff starts being sent out to the masses and the party officially begins.", "-Congratulations were in order for all the players. It took us like eight months real time to finally defeat the kraken but we did it. Now the rest of the session was just to play some fun party games and meme hard(er than usual). The DM just couldn’t wait for the witticisms, sarcasms, jokes, trolls and foolery that his players would come up with this time. *eye rolls intensify*", "The Lantanis Feast", "-There were gymnasians, pirates, dragonborn and aquans all partying together and in harmony together everywhere, people eating and drinking and talking. ", "-Tortles doing shoeys and zorans wrestling with each other. Mermaids being hit on by mermen and tritons. Wah’ter decided to also try his luck hitting on some mermaids by playing the royalty card and seeing where it would get him. Spoiler alert, he wouldn’t be getting any as usual.", "-Kids were also playing pin the tail on the mermaid... or sea donkey if that’s what you picture in your headcanon. In reality, this feast was just a great big party for all the survivors of the war. Something well deserved too. There was general happiness and fun to be had for everyone here.", "-Ro’nok decided that his first port of call would be to down as many barrels of Aquan wine as half-humanly possible. By the third barrel the half-orc, who had a constitution that shouldn’t be laughed at, was already feeling rather tipsy. This didn’t stop him from challenging the rest of the party members to a drinking contest unfortunately. Tim and Dig were both seated at a table quietly drinking some mugs of ale that were imported from the surface. Aquan wine didn’t seem to suit their palette. The two spellcasters of the party declined. No way were they going to enter a drinking contest with this madman. Ubo was still busy serving food and drinks to the people. That left only Wah’ter, who of course obliged.", "-The drinking contest between the two heavyweights was very one-sided. Of course, it was a little unfair to begin with because Ro’nok already had so much of a headstart. From the get go, it was going to be an uphill battle. Ro’nok was completely out of commission by the second round and when he awoke, he found himself dancing on the stage with a couple of burly mermen. Ro’nok had lost all of his clothes once again and had a pair of knickers on his head and only some lingerie to preserve his dignity. Still, he loved it. Ro’nok loved a good party.", "-After Wah’ter finished his drink, he suddenly recalled that there was one matter of business that he had to attend to: Dustin Hoggman’s arrest. The prince trudged over to where the Gymnasian was sipping away gleefully at his ale. He called for some of the guards but they were reluctant, most people here only wanted to party and felt that such matters could be left until afterwards. But Wah’ter was stubborn and wanted instant gratification. This was personal. He forced a confrontation between himself and Dustin Hoggman. Other Gymnasians came to intervene, as did Ro’nok, Dig, Ubo and a handful of royal bodyguards. Dustin Hoggman tried to reason with Wah’ter but it seemed that words would mean nothing to our stern triton protagonist:", "Realising the inevitability of the situation, Dustin Hoggman takes one last sip of his drink before surrendering himself to the royal guards. He is promptly clamped in handcuffs and directed towards the Dungeons of Coral. “Lord Wah’ter. There is something I want to tell you before I’m off.”", "“What is it?” Wah’ter is intrigued.", "“Two more celestial arms remain in this land. I’ve been doing some research of my own this past year and I have a faint clue of their whereabouts. One is said to reside in the realm of the dwarves and the other in the swamps of the Arafura.”", "Wah’ter nods. “That information shall be good to put use.” He turns to his men. “He isn’t resisting. Treat him with courtesy and respect.”", "“Much obliged, my lord.” The hogman gives a curt nod. “I hope you enjoy your party. It was a real honour to take part in killing the kraken. It’s… the least that I could do for Hugh.” He shoots a wink at Dig.", "Dig feels some inner turmoil but decides that it is best not to meddle with foreign affairs, especially not when Wah’ter is involved. That is a bloody headache.", "-And just like that, the DM lost another valuable NPC to the whims of one of his players. Now he would have to redesign a new NPC that would lead the Gymnasian allies. After much thought, I’ve decided to create the second in command to be a Lionman by the name of Leo Leonhardt- or as he’s more commonly known by his men- Leo Leo. ", "-The party also engaged in a talent show. This was a lot of fun. The party split off into teams and set about organising a special feat for the crowd. Ro’nok was the first to do his part. He picked up an oval shaped rock, something which he insisted on calling a footy, and did a beautiful dropkick into the crowd. He asked for the blessing of Nat Fyfe and then leapt over into the air in order to mark the egg-shaped rock-ball. Unfortunately his god responded by berating him for his drunkenness and punishing him by screwing up his flight path. Ro’nok was so smashed at this point that he somehow ended up in the rubble of a collapsed section of wall. He would lie unconscious here until the end of the talent show. ", "Wah’ter and Ubo came up with a gymnastics number and did pretty well considering Ubo’s lack of agility and acrobatic skill. Ubo was about to faceplant into the ground but managed to quickly cast a misty step and teleport himself upright beside Wah’ter. They took their bow and the crowd seemed mightily impressed.", "-Dig and Tim decided to one up their peers’ performance with some storytelling. Now let it be said that storytelling is an art and we should respect those that storytell every two Sundays for their friends ;))))))))))))))))))) ", "-Dig and Tim retell the story of the battle with the kraken and the defence of Lantanis with some... ‘minor’ embellishments. Of course they added some more twists and turns and really emphasised the heroics of the protagonists but all in all, the story was pretty consistent. Tim was busy using his prestidigitation to wow the crowd as Dig spun the tale. During Tim’s magic show however, he found that there were some stick figures intruding in there doing some lewd acts while dressed in very provocative outfits. He looked into the crowd and spotted Ubo doing some weird hand gestures. SABOTAGE! Tim and Ubo had a mental battle which led to Ubo losing drastically and getting knocked out. Tim managed to salvage the situation and with that, secure the victory for their team. ", "*On a side note: I’m rewarding Dig and Tim for willing the talent show by giving them both an extra spell to learn when I send through the level up changes next week.", "-The strength contest also ended up with Ro’nok making a fool of himself. The strength contest was measured by an ancient aquan machine that measured the strength of a blow after being struck with a novelty hammer. A lot of strong people joined but Ubo was the one that pulled up the greatest number, even beating that of Wah’ter in his abomination form. Ro’nok opted to use his own hammer for the machine instead which caused the machine to explode. This sent the hammer flying into the air and then crash down onto Wah’ter’s head, dealing significant damage in the process.", "-One of the mages under Horatio also tried to provoke Dig and Tim into a mage battle to prove who was the greater of the two but they were having none of it. Neither Dig nor Tim were taking the bait given to them by the DM. They were more interested in destroying all the mages gathered here trying to spur them on. Petrified at the prospect of facing potentially the two strongest mages in all of Thera, the challenge was quickly dropped by the crowd. ", "-Some other good news, Ubo managed to hire a new head chef for the Shellebrity Chef from one of the top competing restaurants. In a surprise twist, he appointed none other than Angel, the zoran salt merchant that they previously encountered in the Saltflats. It turned out that she was saving up money from her business in order to start an apprenticeship at one of the top establishments. Now she was the executive chef of one of the most successful restaurants in all of Lantanis. It is funny how life works sometimes. Ubo’s new life goal was to now start a restaurant chain on the surface. His first one was going to be in Arcabern. This gave the tortle a newfound resolve to kill Lucifer once and for all so he could begin the Shellebrity Chef franchise in Australis.", "-Wolyn and Wah’ter eventually made up during the party even despite all the awkward feelings between them. Wah’terw as playing hard to get from the get go but when their favourite song started playing, they couldn’t help but enter the dance floor and begin to bust some moves. Wah’ter went crazy on the dance floor and did all sorts of crazy 21st century dances, most of them inspired by fortnite most probably. Wolyn found herself falling in lover all over again", "-Still, all in all this party was quite a fun one and it allowed for everyone to blow off some much needed steam. Miraculously, Ro’nok even survived all of it without any significant liver damage. ", "The King’s Exit", "As all bathe in the party’s revelries there is a sudden announcement by King Poseidon who directs everyone’s attention to him. He is now wearing a cloak over his golden deepsteel armour and has his trident with him by his side. ", "Everyone falls silent.", "Sturn asks, “Father, what are you doing?”", "King Poseidon closes his eyes and all is still. Then...", "“My people. It brings me great joy to see everyone here gathered today now with a future. A chance for us all. But I have also been reminded of how much I failed you as a king. In my ignorance, our city was devastated by cultists on our very own doorstep, and assaulted by thousands of monsters from the darkest corners of our seas. I have let many loved ones of yours die. So I have a decision…”Banyth tries to step onto the stage but is stopped by Poseidon. “Father, you cannot mean to say…”", "“It is time for me to relinquish my kingship. From this day forth, with all the powers once vested in me, I name your next king. You know this man well. He was the leader who had the foresight to journey to the surface. He was the martyr exiled for a crime that he did not truly commit. He was the warrior that charged head on at the foe fearlessly. He is of the Drowned One’s image. Your rightful king! KING WAH’TER!”", "The crowd roars and the sound of Wah’ter’s name rings clearly through the streets.As the realisation strikes Wah’ter and his companions, the former king pulls the hood over his face and scans the crowd for Tim. “Farewell citizens of Lantanis. May King Wah’ter lead you to a brighter future.”", "And with that, he is gone.", "-Tim messaged Poseidon and the two of them met together at the back where Tim asked Poseidon for the purpose of his disappearance. The wizard was suspicious of what intentions the man had. However it soon became clear that the king was simply imposing an exile of himself after believing he had failed his people too many times. With that, Tim cast an invisibility on the king, who wished Tim the best of luck. Tim also wished the man well on his journey and the two parted ways", "-Meanwhile, Wah’ter was still shocked at the sudden disappearance of his father. Still, his duty was to his people and so he addressed them. He promised to be a good king and to bring the city to an even more glorious future. He pledged his armies to the cause of repelling the demon invasion once more, this time with more authority. A thought did cross his mind to change the law regarding incestuous relationships but he decided that now was not the time.", "-The crowd’s reaction was still a mixture of awe and disbelief. Most of them agreed with Poseidon’s decision. They witnessed Wah’ter’s heroics on the battlefield and knew that a warrior-king was exactly what they needed in these trying times.", "-When Wah’ter returned, Dig had something to tell him. Supposedly his ancient elven amulet, the Eye of Melora, had detected the king. He was headed towards the direction of the Neptulon gate. Armed with this information, Wah’ter quickly rushed to get there in time to speak to his father one more time. ", "Saying Farewell to Father", "Wah’ter’s father turns to his gaze. He is smiling. Wah’ter hasn’t seen him truly smile ever since his mother passed.", "“What are you doing here, son? You’re missing the celebration,” Poseidon said.", "“Father.” Wah’ter looks behind to make sure he hadn’t been followed. “Where are you going?”", "Poseidon’s smile fades and he pauses to consider how to best respond. “Son. Look at the world out there. There is so much we do not understand and so much beauty we could never imagine. What lies out there in those faraway places? I know not where I am headed, my boy. I may even perish along the way.”", "“So why go then?”", "“It was time, I think. It was time.” King Poseidon places a reassuring hand on ", "Wah’ter’s shoulder and squeezes firmly. “There is no prouder moment in a father’s lifethan to see his boy become his own man. You will make the finest king that Lantanis has ever seen.” He glances down at the trident by his side. “I shan’t be needing this any longer. Take it. May it serve you as well as it served me.” ", "The king presses the haft of the trident into Wah’ter’s chest and the abomination holds it in turn. “Thank you father, I will treasure this.”", "“Treasure not only this, but your companions also. Cherish them. You may not realise it now but they are your lifelong friends. When the time comes that you face this Lucifer, they will be the ones by your side fighting with you.”", "“I- I’ll try.”", "“And treat your siblings well. Blood is thicker than water.”", "“Yes, father. Of course.”", "Satisfied, the former king of Lantanis pulls the veil over his head once more and turns to walk into the unknown. Even in doing so, he is unable to conceal the tears trickling down his cheeks. ", "Wah’ter chooses not to comment. Instead he says, “Lantanis will always be at your call, father.”", "Poseidon says not a word but begins his exodus into unexplored seas. ", "The king of old departs. ", "The new king is risen. ", "3. Windar ", "Aboard the Dragonfly Once More ", "-Wah’ter formed a new council for Lantanis comprised of his remaining family members in the city. They would take care of things while he was gone. Banyth, Sturn and Aryn would remain behind and direct matters while Wah’ter ventured forth with his armies onto the land. General Hydro would still be in charge of the tritons but as for the rest of the forces... Ubo was promoted to Lord Commander of the forces. Ubo was absolutely stoked and this increased the loyalty and admiration he had for his now king", "-Wolyn was originally supposed to remain behind as well with the council but she was lovesick and also wanted to explore more of the outside world. There wasn’t much of an argument from Wah’ter on his end. Sure, he wanted Wolyn to stay back and be safe while overseeing the people but at the same time, he really wanted to explore the world with the love of his life ", "-In the end, the party all once more went aboard the Dragonfly, with the new admiral Bickman at the helm. Together they set their flight path back home to Windar. The Philosopher’s Stone lit up and the engines roared. Just before leaving, some cargo was brought aboard. It turned out that Unit A.B. was still non-functional and was being transported in a metallic box. Tim would make a special arrangement for Unit A.B. to be kept under supervision until they could locate Master Panvon (because if you recall, Master Panvon was captured by the enemy during the raids on Lantanis by the Dark Beast Cultists)", "-Tim and Dig had a small rest while they were on the ship. Although I personally forgot to mention it during the session... here’s a retcon: both of them had a dream where they glimpsed the rift in the Badlands growing even larger than before and a brief vision of an ancient elven city. A voice was also calling out to them, Doran’s voice. WHAT IS HAPPENING?", "Arrival at the Docks", "Admiral Bickman commands the crew to furl the sails and all watch eagerly from the upper decks as The Dragonfly makes its graceful landing into the jewel of the North. She lands at the docks of Windar where few ships save for merchant and trading barges are still moored. The Dragonfly stops at the waters and the walking plank is lowered onto the quay. Each step onto the plank is slow, especially for Ubo and Wah’ter who are still yet to find their land legs. For the rest of the surfacers however, this is their first step on solid land for the very first time in a week. A sizeable crowd has already gathered to celebrate the triumphant return of the heroes.", "“Bickman and the Boys are back! Australis is saved! Australis invicta!”", "The sun is beaming on Tim’s face, fine sea water sprays against his skin while seagulls call in the distance and the glorious smell of pig shit wafts in the air. ", "“Yep, definitely back in the capital,” Dig mutters. ", "Fus calls from the helm. “We’ll dock up here and get started on maintenance, admiral.”“Good man.”", "For Ro’nok, it is the first time that he has ever seen this city. He has heard of it obviously; it is the second largest fortress-city in Australis after Arcabern itself. But being a travelling mercenary, his jobs usually took him elsewhere, especially over in the Eastern and Southern regions of the country. He was usually paid for a job and that was it. But here he was feeling more than that. He could get used to basking in this warm sunlight and adoration- even if it wasn’t specifically for him, rather for his travelling companions. ", "Wah’ter extends out his hand to assist his sister Wolyn on walking onto the pier. She gasps. “This is beautiful.”", "“Not compared to you.” Wah’ter winks and brings her closer to him. “This is Windar, the capital of North Australis.”", "“The architecture is... and the colours... how bizarre.”", "“You know there’s an inn around here that I am quite fond of. Maybe we can spend some time there. You know, for some alone time?”", "“Oh,” she blushes, “you-”", "“-yeah I’m keen.” Ubo smiles.", "Gizzard is the last to disembark the ship but betrays little emotion. He continues to dwell inside his mind, thinking about his people and his people alone. He is getting rather impatient.", "Suddenly, a powerful aura and presence causes all of them to freeze on the spot. It isn’t sinister but it is extraordinarily powerful and overbearing. A power so majestic and holy that it makes the heroes feel like succumbing to it and bowing in deference. But with all their might, the party resist. They are wary that there might be a foreign dignitary or king trying to exert some sort of authority.", "But they are wrong.", "Out of nowhere, a huge mass is galloping towards them at full speed. Loose stones, rocks, dirt, sticks and shrubbery are flung all over as this thing thunders towards the group. It’s massive! About ten metres in length, long razor sharp claws, beautiful globe-like eyes and majestic, golden scales... ", "Their eyes widen. Auron! ", "The golden dragon that has been with Bickman and the Boys since the beginning tumbles into Dig Bickman and knocks the wind out of him while licking his face enthusiastically. ", "Dig laughs heartily and pats the near-adult size dragon. The joy of seeing Auron outweighs the crushing pain of the dragon’s weight on his chest. It then jumps up gleefully seeing the rest of the heroes, causing ground tremors. Some of the crowd even run away screaming at the sight in fear of an earthquake.", "Auron begins speaking to them psychically. “I can’t believe you’re all back again! Dad, look how much I’ve grown!” ", "Wah’ter looks from side to side. “Is he talking to me?”", "Dig folds his arms and nods approvingly. “You’ve grown into a strong lad.”", "Auron finally turns his attention to the new member of your party, Ro’nok. “Food?”", "“Yes,” said Ubo and Wah’ter without hesitation.", "The half orc takes a few cautious steps back. “Guys... come on now let’s not play around.”", "“Not food,” Dig said. “Friend.”", "Ro’nok shudders. Does Auron look disappointed? Even so, he can’t help but edge a bit closer to see this thing for himself. Dragons haven’t been sighted for many millennia according to most records. This is unbelievable. As a mercenary he had heard tales of a black dragon attacking Australis two years ago, but news of a young golden dragon? Preposterous. But it makes sense to him. His new friends always brought it up with him while they were in Lantanis, but now here was concrete evidence. Ro’nok has renewed faith in the cause and in his purpose.", "The crowd’s cheers renew again and the party turns their attention to the commotion. Even a blind man would not miss the three figures currently proceeding down the streets. Luxanna Dawnchaser, the Dragon Empress, strides down the street with a golden sceptre and an elegant, silky white gown that drags on the ground behind her as she walks. This catches the attention of Wah’ter, who cheekily elbows Tim. Commoners and nobles alike fall to their knees and bow as she steps past. On either side of her are her two advisors. Jomoan d’Arc the Templarus Knight-Captain remaining vigilant in her ornamental plate and Sabrina the Teenage Witch standing idly at the other side.When they reach the party, they do not fall to their knees. But most bow their heads as a sign of respect. Dig ensures that Auron doesn’t bow. Auron should bow to no one. ", "Sabrina gestures towards the dragon, “Looking after him is impossible. He may be large but he still has the mind of a child.”", "“Who are you calling, child?” Auron pouts his lips. ", "Lux gives everyone a warm embrace. She hugs Tim the longest and it is obvious she is reluctant at letting go. The Dragon Empress stops at Ro’nok. “I do not believe we have met, sir.”", "“How’s it going? The name’s Ro’nok.”", "This aggravates Sabrina to no end. “Uncouth cur! You will address her majesty with the proper respect owed to the Dragon Empress!”", "“Oh I- apologies my lady. I’m just a simple mercenary and not too great with the whole politics thing hey. I mean no offence.”", "“No offence taken, Ro’nok the mercenary.” Lux’s smile shines radiantly. “Any friend of the Boys is a friend of the crown. You are welcome in the city of Windar, Ro’nok.”", "The paladin seems pleased. “Nice.”", "“Well, seeing that you are all here that can only mean one thing… did you do it? Did you defeat the kraken?”", "Each of the party members want to make a sarcastic comment. It takes all of their self control to answer the empress truthfully. Upon hearing of the dark apostle’s demise, the people gathered begin to cheer even louder than before and some now dance in the street. Even onlookers from their windows wave their handkerchiefs and sing of the victory.", "Lux clasps her hands together like a giddy schoolgirl. “That is wonderful! Though… I don’t see the rest of the fleet behind you. Are you all that remain?”", "Dig explains that the rest of the fleets would be arriving in a few days. He also points out that Dustin Hoggman is arrested under Lantanis law. She is curious about this but chooses not to pursue any further. Wah’ter, in his abomination form, didn’t look incredibly receptive to questions.", "“I see.” Lux pauses for a moment to digest all of this information. “Well, I have no doubt that you are weary from your travels. I know, more than anything, you probably wish to rest. Unfortunately we do not have that luxury at the moment. Meet me in the Dragon Cabinet Room tonight. I will call the other councillors that remain in the city. There is… much to discuss.”", "“Ever onward,” Tim mumbles.", "Jomoan’s plate mail noisily shakes as she walks up behind the Empress. “My lady, we should return to the throne room. You don’t want to keep the people waiting.”“Oh joy,” Lux says. “Well I must be off now, Boys. Remember-tonight. Ivory Keep. Farewell.” Lux bows and prepares to take her leave.", "Sabrina whistles, “Come now, Auron, time to go hunting.”", "Auron flutters his wings enthusiastically. “Yes! Hunting! Auntie Sabrina is actually a little nice sometimes!” ", "“Oh, spare me.” ", "Auron says, “I’ll see you later guys! Want me to bring back some scorpions for you?”", "“Yes.” Dig gives Auron a thumbs up. “You do you, buddy.”", "“Okay! See you guys later!” ", "Sabrina bows too. Unusual. The Academy Archmage never bows for anyone save for Lux. “Boys.” She then turns to Tim. “Magister.” And she takes her leave.", "“Magister,” Wah’ter echoes while winking to Tim.", "“Oh piss off,” Tim grumbles.", "The Boys Hit the Town", "-Wah’ter took Wolyn around for a sightseeing tour around the city, stopping at several of the finest establishments. Most of these were the brothels and love hotels and other such upstanding locations. Wolyn seemed mesmerised by the structure of the city and the many fine foods and wares that were for sale in the Masar Palam. Ubo was also here, third wheeling harder than a tricycle. Wah’ter didn’t mind though. He was pretty happy actually. The King, his future queen and the Lord Commander all taking a stroll in a surface city. Life was good.", "-Gizzard also decided to take a walk in the city while thinking about his next moves. He was planning to bring it up during the Dragon Council. He had made up his mind while on the airship. Things would have to change or he was going to leave.", "-Ro’nok more or less did the same as well. He ended up in the Copper Quarter for the most part and decided to hit the town for some more booze. The halflings were very scared and some of the people even weary of him. He was a half-orc just like the traitor Saroza. It was going to take some time to repair the stigma and damage done by the ranger.", "-Dig went for a small stroll as well, not really going anywhere in particular. He struggled to recall the many peoples and places that he had been to before and ended up just going in circles around each of the quarters. Really, more than anything, he was just enjoying some time off after fighting a literal apocalyptic beast a couple of days ago.", "-Tim decided to be more proactive during his time. The wizard was always running on the 6th gear so it was hardly surprising that he travelled to the Academy to see whether he could gather more information. He made his way into the Archives Room of the tower where he met the head clerk, Teller. He rarely ever talked to Teller because their businesses never coincided with each other, but he had heard that the man was reputable and honest, as well as diligent with his work. Tim enquired about the events underneath the city where they had fought Yoshimitsu and after a tragic twist of fate, lost three of their companions in the process. Teller admitted that they had not discovered anything except for a few goblin corpses, which was weird considering that Styx had pledged his people to the demons, as well as a dagger found on the ground.", "-Tim inspected the dagger and immediately realised what he was holding in his hands. It was the celestial arm that once belonged to Hugh and was then passed onto Robin. The Dagger of Time. Tim carefully pocketed the dagger into the bag of holding (where the head of Bronyl was still decomposing OMG Boyd wtf) and promised to keep it safe for the time being. He asked Teller if there was anything else he should know, to which Teller explained that all mages experienced the same dream yesterday regarding the Badlands rift and a disembodied voice crying for help. Tim recalled having this very same dream (ggez retcon) and reminded himself to bring it up with Sabrina during hte meeting later that night. ", "The Dragon Cabinet- Small Matters ", "-The party met up in the cabinet room of the Ivory Keep. Ro’nok himself wasn’t exactly on the council but he was a guest of honour thanks to his association with the Boys. Auron was seen sleeping outside in the palace courtyard and snoring so loud that it could be heard within the meeting chambers. Gathered around the table were the councillors who remained behind in the city. ", "-Sultan Ala’din (Sultana is indisposed), Musashi, Yurtruz, Arthalas, Varrus, Sabrina, Jomoan and some others, as well as Lux of course leading the entire council", "-There was much to discuss and the first order of business was an official congratulations to the party for their triumph on the seas. It meant one less dark apostle to deal with and a step closer to victory. The celebration was short-lived however as they delved into the matters at hand:", "Musashi begins by discussing the war effort. “I will have my men send you written reports of the war. But in short, we are fighting on several fronts at the moment. Thanks to your victory on the Lantanic Ocean our forces can fight without fear of a flank. Two weeks of fighting and most of our battles are pyrrhic victories. We assume that the enemy is being led by a Dark Apostle but we have not yet spotted him on the field. Do the Boys have any clue who we could be facing?”", "Ubo tries counting on his fingers but keeps losing count above one.", "Tim feels Barnabus tugging at his waistbelt and he unclasps the book’s restraints. Barnabus splutters out that the most likely candidate is Pride, who’s whereabouts and identity are unknown at the moment.", "Musashi whispers this to the leader of the Ironshadows, Sakura, who commits this to memory for her lord. “No matter who he is- every time we push them back, reinforcements appear from nearby rifts. We cannot keep this up for longer. I believe that these rifts are the key to stemming the tide. But we do not know how to close them.”", "Sabrina speaks up. “I believe we may have an idea. My apologies for speaking out of turn, but several of my acolytes as well as other mages have all experienced the same vision just recently. Perhaps Dig or Tim could shed some light on this?”", "Tim mentions that he may have an inkling of an idea regarding the Badlands. This isn’t the first time that he had been receiving visions from there and he suggests to everyone that this should be their next destination. Aside from the obvious, he isn’t able to give much insight to the ancient home of the elves. This is strange as normally the wizard is quite open and knowledgeable about most things. Is Tim hiding something or is he genuinely as in the dark as everyone else?", "Arthalas remarks, “The Badlands. You believe that the ancestral home of my people is key to solving all of this? And this Doran, who I believe I met briefly at the Banksia World Tree, is somehow involved in all of this?”", "Tim nods. “It is as you say, Arthalas.”", "Varrus, the dwarf leading the Urulu Outrider Cavalry, chimes in. “You shouldnae travel to the Badlands like some wee stroll. That lassie will ‘av you on the ground in your own pish like some plastered bawsack. You’ll need a dwarf or two if ye thinkin’ of setting foot in that gaff!”", "“Oh joy. More dwarves.” Dig smirks.", "Lux interrupts. “Let us discuss our next moves after we have gotten around the table. We should do things in order lest we devolve into chaos. Sultan Ala’din do you have any concerns or matters to bring to the Dragon Council?”", "Ala’din shakes his head, “Nothing to report, my lady. All is as should be. But again, the constant stream of reinforcements from these rifts is taking its toll on morale. Hopefully we can get to the bottom of this sooner rather than later.”", "Yurtuz says, “Rumours amongst the orcs is that Styx the goblin warlord traitor has been spotted on the frontline.”", "Tim and Dig’s ears both prick up at the mention of their former companion. Perhaps they were going to meet up again in the near future. They have a lot to get off their chest, undoubtedly.", "Lux turns to the wizard. “And what of you, Tim?”", "Tim makes a mention about him losing his lordship after certain events in the Lantanis seas. This announcement does very little in terms of his seat on the council. As a magister, he was quite an authority in Windar and so all in all, the news that he was no longer a lord of a land amounted to very little. Tim discusses the pathways to the Badlands and states that the roads from Sylvanus are going to be the most direct. He is right of course and this intrigues Varrus especially, who wonders how a mere human came to this knowledge. The Badlands aren’t exactly charted territory and only someone who had been there before could be privy to this exact knowledge.", "Next, Jomoan introduces herself to Ro’nok and thanks him for taking care of Yarrick, one of their own in the Templarus Order. She awards Ro’nok with a holy pendant imbued with the power of Akatosh and Celeste. Although Ro’nok isn’t part of the council, Lux still believes in asking him about his insight to the war effort and any other tidbits of help that he can provide. Ro’nok shrugs and admits that he has little to offer. ", "However, he is sure that this Badlands is undoubtedly where the answers will lie. ", "Lux turns her gaze now to the dwarf. “Varrus, you have been good to the people of Australis. How does it go with the dwarven kingdom?” ", "The dwarf smirks. “The same ol’ shite if I’m honest, uh, me lady- apologies for me language. King Hrothgar is still cryin’ like some wee bairn that lost their teddy. An outright shame considerin’ how many of us there are in the mountains. But I do have a proposal for our charmin’ heroes if they were willin’ to listen to little old me.”", "The party listen in.", "“It’s no secret that the dwarves bear a grudge. We have a damn book fer it fer cryin’ out loud! But even as stubborn as us dwarves our, we cannot ignore the threat on the surface for much longer. King Hrothgar and the other dwarven nobles won’t listen to a common footsoldier like me, but perhaps if the heroes of Australis were to pay a visit... well who knows, you might just have a fightin’ chance after all. Whaddya say laddies? Urulu is on the way to the Badlands anyhow.”", "“It doesn’t seem like we have a choice. We will run with that.” Tim agrees.", "Varrus laughs heartily. “Brilliant! Naturally, I’ll be comin’ with. Someone’s gotta protect your arses.” He chuckles again and takes a swig of dwarven mead which he seems to have been concealing the entire time.", "Arthalas also raises a hand. “I would like to accompany the group as well. Large formations would be too noticeable by the enemy so sending a small task force will be our best way of infiltrating the ruins.”", "Lux nods and puts her hands together. “If Bickman and the Boys can somehow stir the stone heart of King Hrothgar then there might be hope yet. I hear that there are tens of thousands of dwarves in the mountain. We could really use their help. Moving on…”Dig is the next to speak and he mentions the fate of Master Panvon and Unit A.B. This causes the entire room to fall into silence for a little while. The implications of Master Panvon’s capture by the enemy is very apparent. They clearly captured the man for his talents at creating golems. Facing demons and artificially created beings on top of that isn’t exactly the most enjoyable thing in the world. Unit A.B. on the other hand would be useful to have on their side, what with her destructive capabilities and all. There is little information on his whereabouts at the moment and so Musashi promises to send out some of his Ironshadows to do some investigating. ", "Wah’ter and Ubo then make their announcements regarding the recent leadership changes back in Lantanis. Lux stands up from her seat to shake Wah’ter’s hand. Wah’ter, in his menacing abomination form, stands up and extends his own.", "“I look forward to our people working together, King Wah’ter.” Lux seems sincere.", "“Lantanis stands with the alliance,” Wah’ter says with pride.", "Next is the last order of business. Arthalas looks like he has waiting for the entire time. ", "“Arthalas, council member of the Banksia World Tree elves, do you have matters to bring up to the Dragon Council?”", "Arthalas nods. “Yes your grace. I suppose it is time. Doubtless many of you have caught wind of this already. But I will outline it for those here that have not. The elves of Australis do not want conflict between us and our allies. We wish to work together for the betterment of all. However, this is not possible so long as we allow the atrocities by a certain councillor.” He whistles to signal someone.", "The door into the meeting room opens and inside steps some familiar elves that many of the party have met prior. Dom, the strong bald headed elf and the three triplets Tic, Tac and Toe. But in their arms they are holding Vlad von Rammstein, the head of the Vampire Counts of Sylvania. His hands are shackled by what looks like dimeritium. What is going on? ", "The four elves dump the count onto the ground and force him to his knees. Vlad flashes a toothy grin and says sardonically, “My, my, we have a crowd.”", "Arthalas unsheathes his sword and points it at Vlad’s neck.", "Wah’ter steps up. “Elf, put down your sword. What is this barbarity?”", "The rest of the party members sit in stunned silence. ", "The elf shoots a glare at the triton king. “There is nothing to explain. My men were being overrun by the enemy near the south and were on the verge of defeat. We were ready to fight to the last man. But as the sun was just starting to set, we saw on the horizon,” he enunciates the following name with certain disdain, “Vladimir. Von. Rammstein. Arriving with fresh reinforcements. We had not heard of any new forces being deployed near us. How did he manage to attain such a number of troops in such a short span of time? Still, we continued to battle and because of his assistance we triumphed that day.”", "“That’s excellent news,” beams Ro’nok.", "Arthalas continues. “But then in the middle of our celebration we all came to a dark realisation. The reinforcements that he had brought were suddenly crumbling all around us into dust. One by one they collapsed into ash till all that was left was mountains of white powder all around us. Don’t you see, my friends? This VAMPIRE committed the atrocious act of necromancy. He had raised our dead brethren and forced them to fight again as… SLAVES AND PUPPETS!”", "Vlad doesn’t seem moved. “I will not lie. That is what I did. If you want to lose the war, fine. Stick with your moral high ground. But the vampire counts know that survival is all that matters. Isn’t that right, Sabrina?”", "“Hm.” Sabrina turns away. “I do not wish to speak to you.”", "“Silence!” Lux says. “We have heard enough. Undoubtedly this is a war crime, Arthalas, and I feel sickened as a former priestess to hear of such an atrocity. Bickman and the Boys. What are your thoughts?”", "Arthalas adds, “I’ll make it easier for you. If you spare Vlad and allow the vampires to have their way with the dark arts, then the elves shall abandon this alliance. We do not take the alliance lightly. I even call some of you friends. But we cannot continue if the foundations of the Empire is built on evil. It’s me… or Vlad.”", "Vlad laughs. “You heard the knife-ear. Do you want to win or lose this war?” ", "-DECISION TIME. Ok so as a whole the party were against necromancy as a practice. No one in their right mind would associate themselves with death magic specifically but the unspoken truth was that in this war on an apocalyptic scale... certain rules and luxuries had to be overlooked in order to win. Therefore the moral dilemma wasn’t whether necromancy was good or bad. It was a question of how far the party was willing to go to ensure victory. ", "-Tim and Dig were both adamant that they wanted nothing to do with necromancy. Even though they also knew deep down the advantages of extra numbers and an unkillable army, they decided it that would not be worthwhile. It wasn’t worth winning in this fashion. Ubo and Wah’ter were also of the same thought but they also didn’t want to disregard Vlad immediately. Wah’ter reminded everyone that those of Lantanis served in both life AND death. Furthermore, Wah’ter felt that Arthalas was essentially holding them hostage with his ultimatum and this left a bad taste in his mouth. ", "-Ro’nok was true to him self as a holy paladin. He would never allow necromancy to occur under his watch and so had a zero tolerance policy for it. ", "-Overall, the party found themselves siding with Arthalas as they decided that it was better to lose with dignity and humanity intact than to win through dark means. Arthalas was very glad that the party sided with him and promised that his people would stick with them till the very end. Vlad on the other hand said that they had just doomed all of Australis. No one could be sure of the future. There was no right or wrong choice here but this would have great implications in the future. ", "-Tim decided that Vlad and his vampires should be excommunicated and kicked out of the alliance. He would be sent back to Sylvania where he would remain neutral in the conflict. How this was going to turn out nobody knew for sure but the decision was made and with that, the meeting concluded for now...", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

He says, “Excommunication is the greatest of mercies for what that vile fiend has done. Were it up to me I would have him executed. But I honour the decision of the council. My people stand with yours forevermore, once again.”Wah’ter leans in to whisper into Lord Commander Ubo’s ear. “He held us hostage...”Ubo agrees quietly. “These surfacers are tricky people.”Lux turns herself to the Academy Archmage. “I apologise for that, Sabrina. I understand that they raised you from an early age.”Sabrina looks away in disgust. “It is irrelevant, your grace. I do as the Council bids and no more.”This is news to the heroes. They are aware of her being a vampire but not the fact that she had some relation to the Vampire Counts in Sylvania. “Sabrina…” the Empress returns her attention to the council. “Our meeting is coming to a close. Is there any here that would wish to bring up another matter?”", "-This is where Gizzard decided to voice his growing anxiousness of the Arafura swamps. Gizzard had been harbouring all of this impatience ever since the party ever met near Allesia Springs. His original intent was always to get support for overthrowing the lizard wizard that had enslaved his people. Now he found himself the saviour of not only Windar but also Lantanis, a city which had no relation to him whatsoever in the ocean of all places. Gizzard requested that they all travel to the swamplands by taking a boat and sailing across the Yarrum.", "-This was a problem. The Yarrum river was still under control by the demons and there was no plausible way for them to travel across the river without being detected by the enemy. The demons would be on them like ants to honey. There was a brief mention of using the Dragonfly as a means of transport, but this too had the problem of easy detection. Besides, the Dragonfly needed to undergo severe maintenance after the terrifying battle with the kraken", "-Musashi promised to give Gizzard more news later down at ‘The Salty Sea Dog’, a particularly famous tavern in the docks at the Silver Quarter. Gizzard began to rush off towards the tavern immediately but not before Tim spoke up to assure the king of the arafuran swamps that as soon as they were done dealing with the Badlands they could make an easy beeline towards the swamps. Gizzard was still within earshot, thanks to some crafty retcon, and grunted as he continued towards the docks.", "-After some discussion, it was decided by the party (the DM really hehe) that the party would be travelling towards the Badlands as intended, accompanied by Varrus and Arthalas. There they would investigate the massive rift that appeared over the ancient ruins of Addadale, and hopefully resolve the problem of a virtually inexhaustible number of enemies. Remember, the Council early on in Chapter 5 theorised that the portals that were bringing up demonic reinforcements on the battlefield, were somehow linked to the great rifts in Australis:", "Lux nods and announces to the entire Dragon Council. “This meeting is officially concluded. The following people will set forth to the dwarven kingdom of Urulu and the Badlands. Magister Tim, Admiral Bickman, King Wah’ter, Lord Commander Ubo, King Gizzard and Paladin Ro’nok.”", "The mention of ‘Paladin Ro’nok’ sends a chorus of laughter from both Ubo and Wah’ter. They held onto each other with one hand while slapping themselves on the knee, howling in laughter.", "Wah’ter wipes a few tears from his eyes. “Imagine not having a proper title LOL!”", "“Laugh my ass off,” Ubo says.", "Ro’nok remains silent. “Whatever man.”", "Lux continues. “They will be accompanied by Varrus of the Urulu Outriders and Arthalas, Master Ranger of the Scout Corps. The people of Australis will forever be in your debts.”", "And with that, the Dragon Council has concluded. The Boys are once again about to embark on a whole new journey.", "-So for confirmation that everybody is on the same page. Everyone will be travelling towards the Badlands first, before securing a passageway into the Swamplands. En route to the Badlands you will be making a pit stop at Urulu. At Urulu you will speak to King Hrothgar about assisting the Australis Empire as well as learn the secrets of whatever ‘anti-radiation’ measures the dwarves use when traversing the Badlands. Arthalas and Varrus will both be accompanying you along the way.", "-The party decided that they would stock up for the journey, knowing that the trek across the desert landscapes of central Australis would be one that took its toll on the mortal body. They would need to plan this out properly or perish in the sands.", "The Salty Sea Dog", "-The first order of business for the boys was visiting the Salty Sea Dog in the Silver Quarter. Gizzard basically led them by the hands to the tavern so that he could discuss the fate of his people and the future of the Arafuran swamps. Inside were seated Sultan Ala’din and Musashi. There was a familiar sight here as a bard was playing a little tune and getting all the patrons hyped. There seemed to be an insufficient number of chairs so some of the party opted to stand around awkwardly while Musashi delivered some interesting tidbits of information to Gizzard. ", "-It turned out that Musashi had learnt relatively little when he sent out his Ironshadows into the swamplands. This wasn’t because they were incompetent in any way but because they discovered that, upon reaching their destination, there was nobody there. The so called Lizard Wizard had vanished, as did the mysterious green woman (Saroza), and even the inhabitants too. Gizzard insisted that this was probably just his people going into hiding due to the swamps being an incredibly huge place. But Musashi wasn’t too sure. Gizzard wasn’t too impressed and even questioned the effectiveness of the Ironshadows. Musashi remained firm and insisted that they would run more searches but for now, they could do very little. This of course motivated Gizzard even more to venture out into the swamps. Now his mind was clear; he would help to sort out this whole rift business with the party, which would allow for a safer route into the swamps through the river. ", "Shopping", "-The party all gathered together to see what supplies they could gather in the Masar Palam of the Bronze Quarter. The Masar Palam was an exotic market and there were goods found from all over Thera, such as Jeeps and armoured personnel carriers which the DM ruled out as probably not realistic for the fantasy setting. In any case, the party counted out the coin that they each had in their personal possession and set about trying to gather goods for the long journey to the Badlands", "-Wah’ter had the brilliant plan of purchasing Wrangler Packs. Now, I can’t personally remember what items were in that pack but there was an abundance of hemp rope, rations, water, and other goods all for a very measly price. In retrospect, this was probably one of the most efficient and valuable purchases that they could have made but holy shit was I triggered", "-After perusing the rest of the wares in the market, some of the party came to the realisation that they were playing themselves. Why didn’t they just visit the requisition stores to see what they could get from the state? After all, they were the heroes saving the people from a literal apocalypse. It was hardly fair that they should spend their hard earned gold on supplies alone. They decided that they would get what supplies they could and the rest from the Ivory Keep’s stores.", "-Before they exited the markets, Tim spied a particularly fancy restaurant which seemed to have quite a name for itself. There were a lot of people gathered outside waiting to dine in this fine establishment. Tim decided that he would take a little gander inside and maybe even bring back some spices for his companion Ubo when they next camped together. Before Tim even made it halfway to the door, he saw a tortle scampering past him at full speed and knocking several people down as the tortle snuck in. It looked as if both of them were going to be doing some food shopping", "The Skyforge", "-The party decided that they would visit Grundle in his smithy in the Bronze Quarter, named the Skyforge. Besides, this was very close to the stables where Dumbo, the last elephant, resided. Dumbo had been holding all of the party’s possessions and their stash of gold for the last two years or so. It was going to be interesting to see what they had left behind in Windar:", "The forge located in the Copper Quarter can be heard from the constant clanging of metals and shouting. The stable is close by and so the scent of animal shit is quite noticeable in the air. As the Boys approach from the cobblestone road and manoeuvre their way past Halfling beggars and working girls on the street edges, they spot the forge in the distance and a long line of people gathered outside. These people appear to be soldiers, mercenaries and other military types. Grundle must be popular. Still, as soon as Grundle spots the party approaching from the south road, the old dwarf blacksmith immediately grins from ear to ear. ", "He stops what he’s doing immediately and yells at the group of twenty to thirty people at his smithy. “Alright now ya bunch of melted wellys, get oan yer ‘orses. I’m closed for the day!” ", "One of them cries back, “But Mr Grundle sir, you’ve only just opened!”", "“Do I have a stutter lad? GET OUT!”", "The crowd disperses and the master blacksmith drops his hammer and brushes his hands on his apron. He steps outside onto the street with arms outstretched. “HEY HEY HEY! Well if isn’t me old pals!” Grundle smells like molten iron and hot coal smoke. But this doesn’t hinder him from walking up to Dig and giving him a great, crushing bear hug.", "Dig manages to get out a few words. “Good to see you too, Grundle. You’ve been keeping well?”", "“Aye. It’s darn good you decided to visit today. Been a wee bit borin’ of late fillin’ out commissions for the lads.” He then strolls on over to Tim and gives him the same enthusiastic embrace.", "The skinny, fragile wizard feels like every bone in his body is being mashed together in a mortar and pestle. “It’s good to see you, Grundle.”", "The master smith then turns to Gizzard, Wah’ter and Ubo. “Ah, I’ve seen you three around before. Well, sorta. Mister Wah’ter you look a bit… funny.” ", "Wah’ter jerks his head back and says incredulously, “Are you guys hearing this? He’s insulting me!”", "“Uh... no I’m just saying-”", "“Let's kill him! Who’s with me?”", "Gizzard grunts. “Ok.”", "“Please lads I'm just tryin' to have a wee old chat!” Grundle retreats a few paces.", "Tim and Dig collectively sigh.", "Ro’nok is curious about the different weapons on the display stands and comes in to take a closer look. ", "Grundle spots this and extends his hand out in welcome. “My, now aren’t you a bulky lad eh? You have to be an orc to be this darn size. Look at those arms! He’s massive!”", "The lizardman looks down at each of his own arms. They are both objectively bigger than Ro’noks. “Puny green man have tiny arms. Hmph.”", "Ro’nok chuckles and subconsciously flexes a little harder than usual. “Ha. Yeah, you know. All that time out in the sun, working as a mercenary, it does things to the body. My name is Ro’nok by the way.”, He shakes Grundle's hand.", "“Nice to meet you sir. Any friend of the Boys is a friend of mine.” He beams.", "Grundle takes a moment to revel in the reunion. Then, “So why’d you lot decide to come to visit ol’ Grundle today?”", "-The party explained to Grundle that they were travelling to the Badlands and needed to get supplies for the journey. Grundle was a bit taken aback with this and made it very clear that the Badlands wasn’t going to be some easy walk in the park. He directed them to the stables where Dumbo had been holding all of their inventory and suggested that they use him as a pack mule. He pointed at the Ivory Keep as where all of the state’s supplies were for the men and to speak to the requisition officer there", "-Gizzard wasn’t shy in asking Grundle whether he had anything for him. As it turned out, Grundle had. The smith presented Gizzard with a beautiful set of plate mail which, on the back, had holes made so that Gizzard’s ‘spine spikes’ could slip through it. It was a perfect fit. The lizardman, using Dig as a draconic to common translator, asked Grundle about the sort of material that this plate was made of. Apparently the dwarves from Urulu had gifted him with an ancient elven plate mail which he used to reshape for Gizzard. He admitted that the secrets of forging with this ancient metal had long been lost and that only a handful of smiths even knew how to reshape it. Still, Grundle told Gizzard that if he was going to the Badlands, it would be a good idea to bring back some materials for him to create more armour pieces for him (DM NOTE: If you ever find some epic shit out in your adventures, always be sure to ask me what you can do with it)", "-The party went past the Skyforge to the stables where they finally reunited with Dumbo. Dumbo was still wearing the giant scorpion carapace armour they had obtained back in the Namati desert and still as much of a chad as ever. The inventory included things like a mummified hand from like the second session, a cask of sake from Musashi from a long, long time ago and quite a hefty sum of gold. ", "-The entire party took Dumbo towards the Ivory Keep where they would see what sort of supplies and equipment that they could use. Ro’nok remained behind to gather some horses for the entire party. For his own steed, he chose a beautiful white steed that had a glistening coat and long mane. He named him Brumby. And from now on, they would be inseparable. Ro’nok chose a very limp and frail horse for Gizzard, probably as a practical joke, we’re not too sure. Ro’nok took the horses that he gathered, five in total, towards the front gate where he would eventually run into a mysterious cloaked figure...", "Ivory Keep Requisition", "-Ubo opted to also not visit the keep with the rest of the party and instead did some shopping of his own to supplement the supplies they would be getting from Windar. In the hour of shopping that the tortle did he managed to buy 100 herbs and spices. Oh yeah, and a fancy Ciggu Teaset. He would wait for Dumbo to return before personally bringing the elephant and the party’s pack to the front of Windar to await their departure tomorrow morning.", "-The rest of the party visited the Requisition officer who granted them seven days worth of supplies and water, four nights worth of firewood and some medical equipment. The food rations also included that needed for their horses. However, this was when Wah’ter came up with a very interesting question: Were they going to take Auron?", "-The party was a bit at odds with this and the general dilemma was whether it was safe or not to bring Auron with them. The Badlands wasn’t exactly renowned as being the most hospitable place in Australis and bringing their dragon with them would be dangerous. On the other hand, Auron wasn’t a kid anymore and sooner or later he would have to learn to defend for himself. One other driving factor was that Dig was getting jealous that Auron was spending so much time with Sabrina instead of him. Therefore, the party decided that they would see what Sabrina and Auron were up to.", "The Palace Courtyard", "-They walked around the keep to the palace courtyard where Auron and Sabrina were indeed training. Sabrina the Teenage Witch was teaching Auron a few simple spells and on how to relax and focus his breath weapon. Auron was obviously disinterested and wanted to go chase birds instead.", "-Seeing the party made Auron incredibly excited and it bounded towards them gleefully. The party outright told Sabrina that Auron was going to be coming along to the Badlands with them. Sabrina, usually indifferent about most matters, was clearly incensed that they even bring up such a request. Sabrina wanted Auron to remain behind in the city where she believed he would be safest and where she could continue to train Auron in defensive magics. Besides, Auron was still a kid at heart, she reasoned.", "-After some arguing, the party managed to win custody of Auron. Sabrina told them that they would have to ask Lux first for permission regardless and to see her first thing. The party promised that they would (at some point). Tim made one more request while he was here. For the past month he had been working on establishing a foothold in a pocket plane that he had discovered during his studies in the Academy. He had tried and failed several times in the past, even using the Philosopher’s Stone briefly, but could not stabilise the portal long enough to see his work unfold. This time though, he had Auron to help him. ", "-He requested for Sabrina and Dig’s aid also. Sabrina agreed reluctantly, if only out of her own curiosity. Opening a pocket plane wasn’t a trivial matter and if Tim was going to be casting such a powerful spell in the city, she felt obligated to oversee it lest he open a portal up into the nine hells. Dig felt like this was putting Auron at risk and didn’t want to at first, but after Tim insisted it would be harmless, Dig relented. Ultimately the dragonborn trusted in the wizard’s judgement and furthermore, Dig being the better mage, he would be able to stop Tim if he went too far. ", "The Academy Tower ", "-Tim, Dig, Sabrina and Auron make their way to the Silver Quarter where they crossed the bridge leading to the famous Academy Tower. Being with Sabrina, they were not bothered by any of the guards of security and they eventually made their way to her office at the top floor. The last time they were here the party ended up fighting water elementals due to setting off the traps and alarms. Thankfully this time they wouldn’t have to deal with these contraptions. ", "-Tim was about to ask Barnabus for his assistance on the matter until suddenly the babbling book burst out, trying to get a word in:", "“But I’m really here now aren’t I? A mere mortal and you ask me to be your pupil? I’ve wandered several lost empires in the hope of finding forgotten secrets. My whole life I wandered in search of the elusive force, the elusive Art. What is magic, I asked myself? What is it? What is? And now I find you, mistress, and you tell me that you wish to grant me the title of Magister? How could I accept? How could…”", "Sabrina and Dig look at each other in silence, unsure of what to make of this. Tim taps Barnabus gently and reassures him. “Barnabus, it’s ok. Relax. You’re here.”", "“Tim? But where is… she was… who was talking… I’m Barnabus. You are Tim. Apologies Magister Tim it seems I was trying to forget something, or trying to remember, I don’t know. Was that today or is it to be? Or was it yesterday or another time or cycle? The mind boggles, truly! Haha! I shall think about this in the meantime!”", "“You... do that.” Tim fastens the clamps on the book and sighs. Barnabus’ gradual degradation is worrying him.", "-Tim began his spell and tried to concentrate his magic. To help with this regard, Sabrina acquired some focusing crystals and set them in front of him where he would concentrate his magic like a beam through them. The magic refracted between the three crystals until it formed a single light that shot out in front of them, creating the portal. Tim then borrowed Auron and Dig’s power as he used it to materialise the realm in front of him. He set about creating the contents of this pocket plane by forming matter into the shape of a mansion. It had a sort of rustic look to it, bricks, cobblestone, farmhouse style manor (perhaps Tim can give more description to this)", "-Even with the extraordinary power and magic available to him at this instant, he wasn’t able to completely materialise the plane and so many of the ‘rooms’ were still not completely developed. But that didn’t matter for him at the moment because finally he had succeeded where he could not in the past. He was chuffed. The party now had somewhere they could be. Finally they could stop being murder hobos. They were now just murderers", "-Sabrina acted unimpressed and decided to grill Tim further on his outstanding school fees. Tim and Dig weren’t too fussed about her rudeness however. Instead, they set about formulating plans for the mansion. The first order of business would be to gather some staff. They would meet with the rest of the party who were still running errands and tell them to get people to man the newly formed mansion within Tim’s pocket plane.", "Gizzard and the Colosseum", "-Gizzard decided that he was sort of bored just walking around the city and needed some real diversion; that being the most primal entertainment of all. He decided that he would test out his luck in the Colosseum", "-The lizardman made his way into the gold quarter at the colosseum back entrance where competitors would usually enter from. Guarding this entrance was two guards by the name of Willy and Wonka. They were wiry and seemed a bit new at the job, so they were quite flustered when they saw this mountain of a man approach them. They told Gizzard that he wouldn’t be allowed to enter unless he had the correct registration papers. However, since registrations had already closed the day prior, there was no way that he would be granted entry. Gizzard didn’t care of course and just strode past them. Willy and Wonka both considered stopping him with words but when this failed they decided to let it be. After all, there were very few men willing to argue with the lizardfolk. ", "-Gizzard walked through the changing rooms and holding cells of the participants. Gizzard arrived in the holding area and found himself standing next to an elf, a dwarf, a tortle and a human. The announcement went off for the finals and he confidently walked out with the rest of them. As he did so, he saw Lux watching over the proceedings. Lux was clearly not amused that he had managed to find his way to the colosseum grounds", "-The battle was quite a breeze for Gizzard. He dealt with the elf first. The elf shot a flurry of arrows which Gizzard dodged with ease. The elf then tried to get into close combat with his dual daggers, but this proved to be quite a folly as Gizzard simply whacked the elf with his hammer, knocking him unconscious. The next attacker was then the human spearmen who charged at Gizzard with reckless abandon. Gizzard dodged the spear and grappled him before forcing him to the ground. He had his jaws ready to clamp down for the kill but the crowd and Lux weren’t having any of it. They appealed to Gizzard’s reason and thankfully on this occassion, Gizzard would grant mercy to his victim. The last two fighters was the tortle and the dwarf. They didn’t last very long either. Gizzard threw the dwarf into the wall and laughed. The dwarf was most likely dead but the officials didn’t dare to check the mess of blood and bone splattered across the floor and walls.", "-Lux declared Gizzard as the winner but since he had not officially registered, the prize would be awarded to the second last man standing- that being the dwarven paste. Gizzard shrugged. He didn’t care. He came here for a fight, not this ‘gold’ that he’d been seeing being thrown around by the party. (The concept of money and wealth would eventually be explained to him by Dig in draconic)", "-On a side note, the two guards Willy and Wonka were also subsequently sacked. Gizzard, not out of concern but more so out of selfishness, told Willy and Wonka that they would be welcome being the guard of their crib in the pocket plane. Without much say in the matter, the two guards were escorted by the lizardman back to the group where they would enjoy slavery to their new masters", "Saying Farewell to Wolyn", "-Wah’ter walked around the city with a clear mind, hoping to get in some more sights of the grand city before departing tomorrow. His thoughts went to his sister Wolyn and where she’d be. He guessed that she’d be in the markets, knowing her sister and her fascination for the surface wares.", "-He was right. He found Wolyn outside one of the stalls in the Masar Palam. She was asking several questions to the poor merchant who had to answer ever single question that was being thrown at him. Eventually, the merchant gave up and left the stall. Wah’ter caught up with her and started to have a conversation with her about what the future held for them", "-Wolyn asked her brother some more questions about the surfacers. She took particular interest in the halflings and asked him whether they were actually just human children or another separate race altogether. Whether Wah’ter was aware of the truth or not, he claimed to her that they were in fact children. This made Wolyn upset- how barbarous of the surfacers to have the children run around in the streets as orphans and without care. ", "-Wah’ter then also explained that surfacers would actually remove their faeces using magic. Naturally, Wolyn thought her brother was joking and dismissed this as a joke. But Wah’ter was adamant and even asked some of the passersby in the Masar Palam to verify it. The first man he questioned simply ran away in fear of the triton but the second person he questioned simply shrugged and confirmed that it was sometimes the case. Yes, they did wipe their ass with magic.", "-When Wah’ter asked for Wolyn to accompany him into the Badlands, she responded by saying that she wished to remain in the city for a while. She wanted to discover more of the city and she also felt that it wasn’t the right time for her to be going off on an adventure so soon, considering all that had happened in Lantanis only a few days ago. Wah’ter accepted her wishes without argument, trusting her judgement wholeheartedly. Wolyn took off the scarf that she wrapped her hair around in and gave it to Wah’ter, asking him to bring it back to her soon. Wah’ter promised that he would. ", "A Strange Discussion", "-Ro’nok was on his way to meeting Ubo, who had just finished shopping for his herbs and spices and teapot, at the front of the city. He had in his hand the reigns from several horses that he had personally hand-picked for his companions. Brumble proudly trotted alongside him ", "-On the way there he was stopped by a mysterious woman (the same one questioned by Wah’ter regarding waste removal). She was hooded, hunched over and had a very senile voice. She lifted back her hood and Ro’nok recognised her as Yurtruz, the orc shaman who was taking a ‘chieftain’ sort of role ever since Saroza abandoned the orcs. She had a little chat with Ro’nok about his upbringing and religion", "-Ro’nok told her that he actually had no idea who his parents were. Clearly he was a half-orc and so one of his parents had to be a human and the other an orc. However, he knew very little beyond that. The first memories that he had of his youth was joining a mercenary group where he would meet a lot of his companions. It was there in fact that he first heard about the mysterious orcish god by the name of Nat Fyfe. He began to worship Nat Fyfe himself and soon found himself in his service as a holy paladin. He would leave his mercenary life behind and begin it anew as a holy warrior of vengeance.", "-This was when Yurtruz got weird and started questioning Ro’nok about this orcish god. She claimed that she had never heard of this god before and that she, being a wizened old shaman, had never encountered an orcish god of vengeance by that name. Ro’nok was confused and unsure of how to respond. He knew that Nat Fyfe existed because he always talked to him and his whole life up to this point had been in service to his holiness. What was this shaman talking about?", "-The shaman was speechless but peered into the eyes of Ro’nok. She seemed to want to say something but decided to withhold it for now. She smiled and went on her way, leaving Ro’nok confused in the middle of the street with his pack of horses.", "The Crazy Prophecy", "-While Ro’nok and Ubo stood guard of Dumbo, their horses and supplies at the front of the city, the rest of the party decided that they would pay Lux a visit in the Ivory Keep. Of course they brought Auron with them, because they had to pretend to ask for permission from the Empress herself to take the empire’s prize", "-On their way to the Ivory Keep they heard a strange voice calling out to them from an alleyway. Curious, they investigated the source of the sound and found a man who looked as if he had seen better days. His clothes were tattered, he had a scraggly beard, unkempt hair and an unbearable odour. They realised that Ked had clawed out his own eyes due to the scratch marks on his face. He was also holding the Black Bible with both hands and clutching it to his chest as if protecting a baby. He started spouting nonsense:", "“Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take heart what is written in it, because the time is near. Look, he is coming with the clouds. Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him. I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, who is, who was, and who is to come, the almighty.” ", "-The party was speechless as the madman raved on about these prophetic insights. He ran down the street continue to ramble on with incoherent sentences. The Boys didn’t know whether to pursue him or not but before they could decide he had already disappeared into the crowd", "Meeting with Lux", "-They entered the throne room and found themselves in the presence of many Templarus Knights and Jomoan standing guard. Lux was perched on the throne, regal and beautiful as ever. The party thought to themselves that Lux seemed to be enjoying this position a bit too much and that perhaps she was letting some of the power get to her head", "-She asked the party for what reason they were approaching her and this was when the party revealed to her that they were going to be bringing Auron with them to the Badlands. Now, this was not a request but rather a statement. Lux argued vehemently that bringing Auron with them would be a big mistake because of the dangers that it would put him through. She reminded them that early on in their journey, both Auron and herself had been prisoners by their enemies due to their lack of ability to protect them. True as this was, Dig spoke up and said that if Auron was to be a powerful and respected dragon, he would have to learn to come to his own being. The danger was a necessary risk in order to mature Auron and have him reach his full potential. Additionally, although Dig kept this to himself, he was getting a little jealous that Lux and Sabrina were spending so much time with his favourite companion", "-Lux sighed and realised that arguing with the people saving her empire was pointless. She reluctantly accepted their request and allowed Auron to travel with them in their quest. Auron was very excited and leapt about the place, causing the stones in the floor to shake at his feet. Seemingly done with the empress, the party turned around to leave. Before they could so however, Lux requested a private audience with Tim alone. Wah’ter gave Tim a nudge and a wink before leaving the two to talk about more... private matters", "-Lux definitely talked to Tim about private matters. She was head over heels for Tim and reminded him that she had had dreams about the previous cycles. In those cycles they were madly in love, married and living in bliss. Furthermore, the land would need an heir, meaning that there would need to be an emperor. Tim was decidedly perfect in her eyes. ", "-Tim, with no tact whatsoever, told her that in those cycles everybody was killed by demons. This cycle was different and so he argued that perhaps it was best that they didn’t run away together in this crazy little romantic fantasy of hers. Lux was visibly upset and some of the party (who were listening in outside like little rats), cringed very hard at the letdown", "-Tim did not let her down lightly and Lux was close to tearing up. She was stronger than before though ever since this position of empress was thrusted upon her shoulders. She accepted that it was probably not the best time. As if to console or placate her sadness, Tim suggested that after the adventure was over, that perhaps they could get together then. Lux saw right through this and simply remained in silence as Tim strolled out of the throne room. *What a cold, cold, cold man. I think I might nerf him for rejecting the advances of my favourite NPC.", "Last Party", "-Lux blesses the party with some exotic dancers and “carers”. Wolyn also decided to pay Wah’ter one last visit. The party bring their guests in to Tim’s pocket plane where they have a wild party. The staff are also introduced to their new home. Maybelline, Grundle, Willy, Wonka and Majordomo Major get familiar with their surroundings. All they needed now was a chef.", "-Andruin, also known to the Boys as Clive, also payed them a visit during this time and announced to them that he had been making fat stacks selling copies of his book. This book was of course the recounting of the party’s journey thus far and was a national bestseller. Ubo decided to take it upon himself to squeeze out every bit of coin from this old man that he possibly could. The best deal that Andruin managed to get in the end was a 50/50 split... which would predominantly be given to Dig due to careful manipulation by the Dragonborn", "-All in all, the party dance the night away in the pocket portal being sustained by Tim. It would be one of their nice nights of respite before they would be off on their new quest. Ever onward for the Boys. ", "Revelations Sunday", "Morning arrives and the party makes their way down the streets towards the front gate of the city. Tim begins the process of dissolving the pocket plane and leads Auron outside with the rest of them.", "“What.about.workers?” Gizzard grunts, pointing to the newly appointed staff still roosting in their home.", "“What about them?” Wah’ter shrugs.", "“They will stay,” Tim replies confidently.", "“Will that be alright?” Dig is the last to step out of the portal. “Won’t they starve in there?”", "Tim explains. “When I cut the link to the pocket portal it is as if it ceases to exist. They are there but they are also not there at the same time.”", "Dig strokes his imaginary beard. “So what you’re saying is... no, I don’t really get it actually but let’s work with that.”", "Grundle waves to them as the portal is closing. “Best of luck to youse all. I look forward to the news when you’re back.”", "The portal shuts and the heroes make their way to the front of the city.", "On their way, they spot Varrus, Tyrande and Arthalas. They are standing outside the Copper Quarter streets and giving their own farewells.", "Varrus steps over to adjust the saddle on his mountain ram. “Donnae worry Tyrande. I’ll take care of your man. Travellin’ with a dwarf is as safe as you could be.”", "Tyrande, Arthalas’ wife, manages an uneasy smile. “Thank you Varrus. My husband tends to forget to look after HIMSELF. Always thinking about others.”", "The scout regiment leader raises both hands in the air. “My safety matters not. I intend to protect the Boys with my life. They are this country’s future after all. Anar’endal dracon.”", "“My love, promise me you won’t-” Tyrande notices the party’s arrival finally. “Oh, they’re here. Ba’ladash, malanore travellers.”", "Varrus takes a generous swig of dwarven ale and offers everyone a sip for good luck. They oblige for the most part, although Gizzard still prefers his swamp juice above all.", "“We should be off now.” Arthalas adjusts his arrow pouch and gives Tyrande a kiss on the cheek. “Shorel’aran my love.”", "They set off again on a leisurely stroll before reaching the Bronze Quarter, knowing full well that it will be quite some time before their return to the city again. Finally, they reach the front gates of Windar. Gathered here is a sizeable crowd of townspeople seeing them off. Ubo wonders to himself what sort of sad lives they must have to always be cheering them on. Why did they always get receptions? Hundreds of Templarus Knights and Academy Mages have been stationed as security while the Dragon Council are positioned here also, including the Empress Lux. The crowd’s cheers immediately renew upon spotting Auron beside the party.", "-Tim didn’t care too much for his own personal attire and this showed quite prominently with his robes. These robes hadn’t been changed at all since the beginning of the journey and so it was now a mismatch of different threads and fabrics. Where the tattered robes had been worn, Tim had sewn it in an attempt to preserve it as best he could; you could clearly see that this was the case. In his hand he held a staff made from the bark of the World Tree. He rarely had to use the staff though due to the celestial arm, Barnabus, which he had strapped to his chest by a sort of belt-like apparatus. He was still good looking- not overly handsome but definitely not bad either. He was just a normal human being with very non-normal magical capabilities. These days he tried very hard to conceal his right (or left? can’t remember will retcon at some point) foot which was a very different shade to the rest of his body", "-Dig was wearing his Ironsilk robe which he had received when aboard the Fat Lady as a gift. The Ironsilk robe was made of a composite material made by the elves that although had the feel of something as smooth as silk, was as tough and durable as iron. It was perfect for someone of Dig’s abilities, where he not only possessed magical prowess but boasted a hearty enough constitution to get down and dirty when necessary- unlike some other spellcaster we know. He had his Ironsilk Robe refashioned by the finest tailors in Windar into an Admirals Jacket which he wore proudly. The colour of the jacket was a navy blue, similar to the colours of his scales, with golden epaulettes sporting a golden dragon for an insignia. Dig Bickman looked like he had a really Dig Bick while walking down the street. Also, as a reminder, his right hand claws were now fully regrown again after he had them clipped by a kuo-toa torturer back in Lantanis", "-Ro’nok was still same old Ro’nok. He had acquired another set of Bronze Armour and was still holding his beautiful hammer, the Fyfer. He had well-maintained, jet black hair and although he looked quite intimidating on the outside, he had a heart of gold. Although Ro’nok had protruding lower canines and a bit of a rough complexion, he was still quite a looker from a completely heterosexual perspective I’m not gay I promise guys please. The paladin was still devoted to his god and despite the curious conversation that he had yesterday with Yurtruz, his faith was unshaken. Ro’nok confidently walked along the rest of his new companions while riding atop his beautiful white steed, Brumble. The rest of his party were also mounted on horses but he had chosen the best one for himself. That being said, Ro’nok had chosen the lamest, frailest, weakest, limp-dickest horse for Gizzard. Nobody was certain whether Ro’nok had done this on purpose, by accident, or as revenge for Gizzard having a bigger hammer than him", "-Gizzard... not that much to say. The party didn’t bring it up much ever since they met him in the deserts but this lizardman didn’t care too much for modesty. Gizzard had essentially been naked the entire time he was with them. The only thing that covered his male parts was a very flimsy piece of loincloth which dangled around in the air precariously. On more than one occasion the DM had to reconsider changing the rating from MA to R for his campaign. The only other noticeable thing of Gizzard’s, apart from his glistening abs and hulking figure, was his massive hammer. That wasn’t a euphemism either. His warhammer which he had fashioned from the tooth of the first sea serpent the party faced while on the Lantanic Ocean, was definitely nothing to scoff at. Any other of the races on the surface would have no hope of even hoisting this thing up with both hands, let alone one. ", "-Wah’ter had decided some time ago that he would remain in his abomination form even when not in battle. It was easier that way and would allow him to tap into his abilities that much easier. For this occasion however, Wah’ter decided that he would maintain appearances for the public so as not to scare them. He scanned around the crowd and couldn’t see Wolyn, which saddened him a little. He couldn’t blame her of course. If he was Wolyn, he couldn’t bare to see someone so handsome and smart and funny as him leaving Windar. In terms of his base appearance, it hadn’t changed much. He was wearing his blue deepsteel plate and now carrying the trident of the House of Nekadh, outfitted with ornamental bling and everything. His face was something akin to that of Jake Gyllenhall but a more bestial appearance due to his demonic inheritance. He waved at the adoring crowd and continued on his way ", "-Ubo was a small tortle with a very big name on his shoulders; Lord Commander. Although a blatant rip off from a show that used to have good writing until D&D decided to say fuck it, Ubo wore the title well. He had the insignia of the House of Nekadh and Lantanis etched onto his shell. This marking was located directly next to the acid burn marks from the torture that he endured on behalf of his lord. If you remember, the torturer was actually about to start onto Wah’ter, but Ubo drew attention to himself in order to protect his then prince. Still, Ubo didn’t seem too fussed at the moment. Ubo held both hands on the reign of his horse and rode beside King Wah’ter as he blew kisses out to people. I should mention that at this point, Ubo still had not recovered his staff from the battle of Lantanis because a shark had consumed it. Hopefully he would be receiving a new one in the future. It shouldn’t hamper him that much though because he was more a mage now than an actual warrior lol", "-Anyway... continuing on:", "Lux is smiling warmly, her golden crown glinting in the sunlight like Auron’s resplendent scales. Gathered around them are the rest of the Dragon Council members. Musashi looks alert and scans the crowd with a sense of duty. It’s very unlikely that anyone from the city would try to assassinate the Empress, Windar love her after all. But it never hurts to be safe. ", "Lux bows and everyone else does the same. “The city is forever grateful for all that you’ve done. Although the future is uncertain, it is comforting to have you by our sides in this time of trial.”", "The party says their final farewells and step through the gargantuan swinging doors of the main gate. Arthalas is riding a unicorn from the old forest, Varrus is riding a mountain ram and the heroes are mounted on their own horses. Dumbo and Auron trail closely behind. They get a fair distance away from the city before looking back one last time for good measusre.", "The crowd behind them wave jubilantly and Lux shouts with both hands to her mouth, “May the gods keep you safe from…”", "She suddenly pauses and clutches her chest as if in great pain. All around her, the knights templarus all fall to the ground onto one knee. She is breathing heavily. “What is... going on?”", "Musashi rushes to the Empress’ side. “My lady, what is wrong? Jomoan?”", "Jomoan is also on the ground, her face wracked in agony. ", "Sabrina commands her mages. “Protect your Empress and the people!”", "All of the party, save for Ro’nok, also simultaneously fall to the ground as a great shock surges through them. ", "Dig winces in pain but instructs the party to return back to the gates.", "Sabrina yells back. “No, stay out of the city. Something is wrong!”", "Confusion is like a contagion, panic is like a virus. It spreads quickly here and soon the air is pierced by screams and mass hysteria. In the skies a twisting black mist snakes itself in the firmament above and begins to smother the sun’s light so that this long, overbearing shadow stretches itself over the lands, encasing all in a shroud of darkness. The clouds cough and churn while a blinding, eerie, green glow emits from behind them. One lone figure plummets towards the earth before the party and smashes into the ground with a sickening crunch. Yet the people in the city continue to scream and panic as if nothing had happened. Can they not see it?", "It’s still alive. The creature is winged, but has a human appearance and body. There’s no question about it. It’s… an angel of some sort. The angelic figure lifts its head slowly to look up at the heroes. It has a golden face but it is cracked and its wings are stained with blood. Ro’nok wants to step up to inspect it and that’s when he discovers that he can no longer move. None of the party can move. Try as they might, it’s like their mind has been separated from their body and they can only watch from within their own prison. ", "The angel begins to speak in a beautiful, sonorous voice. “I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and was given a crown, and rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.”", "Sure enough, a spectral phantasm of white streaks across the black skies. It soars over to the East and disappears from sight. But not before some of the townspeople begin retching violently, some even falling to the ground dropping dead as boils and lesions begin to break out on their skin.", "The angel speaks again. “Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.” ", "A ghostly rider once again appears but this time the rider’s body is composed entirely of hellfire. It streaks across the skies and disappears to the east. Chaos erupts all around. It is sudden and without warning. People begin killing each other mercilessly in a fevered rage with whatever they can get their hands on. Sticks, stones, weapons if they have any. Some of the Knights Templarus and Academy mages even succumb to this violence and begin decimating the people around them with reckless abandon. Those not affected by the haze of madness attempt to scurry off to safety but die after being trampled by the crowd. The last vision the party sees is of Yurtruz is of her getting her arm hacked off by a young man with a woodcutters axe.", "“Protect the Empress!” Musashi roars at the top of his lungs as he decapitates a halfling who gets too close to Lux. The brave hobgoblin warlord takes Lux by the hand and rushes to your position. But before he is able to do so, a child no older than the age of six stabs him in the neck with a spear. He falls, clutching at the wound as his lifeblood trickles into the cracks of the earth.", "Lux is frozen on the spot, unable to feel, unable to move. She reaches her hand out, struggling for one last word. “Tim…” before someone rams a knife into her gut repeatedly with passion. ", "The angel continues. “I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in its hand.”", "As the black horse and its rider rode across the stars, crops and foodstuffs rot instantaneously out in the fields and even in the markets. What was once green and filled with verdant life is now withering or dead.", "Finally, the angel says. “I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and hades was following close behind him.”", "The rider named Death and its steed rode across the stars, and in doing so, signalled the end. The angel’s body begins to dissolve into dust before the eyes of the Boys. Similarly, several people in the city begin aging sporadically and dying from old age. ", "This is how Sultan Ala’din and Jomoan died. ", "One second they were trying to control the crowd and the next they just dropped dead. ", "The party, Varrus and Arthalas finally regain control of their own bodies.", "“What was that?” Arthalas screams. “What is going on in the city, we must return! Tyrande is in there!”", "Varrus berates him. “You’d be damned fools to go back now! You’ll die laddies! Listen to me! We have to get to the Badlands before it’s too late!”", "“Dwarven coward! Boys? What do we do?”", "“Go!” Wah’ter shouts, preparing to gallop at full speed himself. “I understand what you feel. My Wolyn is in danger as well.”", "“If you go,” Tim says slowly, “you will die. We... need to leave.”", "“My king...” Ubo is torn and unsure of what to do. ", "The look on Arthalas’ face is utter despair, pure agony. It isn’t commonplace for someone to die of heartbreak, but when Arthalas collapses atop his unicorn, it seems quite close.", "All of a sudden, several portals begin to materialise in the city and out of them come spewing forth a host of demons and other nightmarish ghouls which maniacally cackle as they shred and eviscerate the people. Entrails parade the streets like red ribbons in a gust of limbs and gore. ", "Sabrina has thrown herself on top of Lux in futility, trying desperately to smother her from the demons and madmen. Her body twitches as knives and spears and swords stick her back. Auron’s voice permeates in the party’s minds. It makes no sense what he is saying but it is pure fear and terror that they feel from the psychic link. That’s when one particular portal opens and catches their attention. Out steps a hulking blue figure with fiery globe like eyes and dark royal blue skin. There’s no mistaking it. ", "It’s Yoshimitsu. ", "He turns to the party and even at the incredible distance between them, he knows. He flashes a malicious smile before he extends his claws and slices Lux’s head clean from his neck. Frozen in shock, the party watch in silent horror. ", "Moments later, they can see their old friends once again. Yurtruz, Ala’din, Musashi, Jomoan, Sabrina and Lux. But this time, their heads are skewered on the tops of spikes being waved mockingly by the enemy…", "Where do they go now? To the left where nothing is right? Or to the right where nothing is left?", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

                    "Part": 3,
                    "Text": ["Day 1", "Camping", "-The party set up camp. It was pitch black, they were in a desert and all was silent except for the gentle humming and chirping of insects. Arthalas was beside himself with grief over losing Tyrande and Varrus distanced himself away from the party, preferring the company of dwarven mead. The rest of the party sat huddled around a small fire and slowly warmed themselves up by the heat. The desert night was chilly.", "-Barnabus was speaking riddles to himself and other incoherent mumblings. Tim was uneasy at the rate of Barnabus’ mental degradation. It was most prominent when they encountered the kraken but the celestial arm had always shown little signs ever since he acquired it in a ruin of the Udakak forest. Meanwhile, Dumbo and Auron were both spooked. The latter sent psychic backlashes to the rest of the party so that they too shared in the dragon’s stress and tension. Dig made sure to spend most of the night caring for Auron and ensuring that the golden dragon knew that he was safe now. Water and food rations were shared amongst everyone and more wood added to the fire. ", "-The mood of the party was mostly grief and disbelief. The good to come out of this entire situation was that it caused each party member, who had for the majority of the campaign been quite distant from each other, to bond together in solidarity. For all they knew, they only had each other now.", "-Varrus explained to the party that the journey towards Urulu would take about four to five days depending on their speed. There were a variety of factors to consider for their journey. For one, they were slowed down somewhat by Dumbo. He was useful to have around because he was carrying all of their supplies and equipment, but there was no way that the elephant could hope to keep up with the steeds that the party were currently riding on. Speaking of which, Ro’nok distracted himself by taking care of his horse Brumble. He fed and groomed the white mare absent-mindedly so as to avoid dwelling on the predicament that they were in. ", "-Gizzard also brought up their next moves. After failing to adequately get his point across in Common, he turned to Dig for help with translating his fluent draconic tongue. Gizzard was proposing to the party that they should make a detour and head towards the Arafuran Swamps instead. Most of the party initially agreed that it wouldn’t be a bad idea. Dig and Tim both recognised that their allies were already growing thin after the loss of Windar. If they did travel to the swamps, they would be able to regroup with the remaining Arafurans and even the Sylvanian Counts that were close by. Unfortunately, they then realised that there were several problems with this idea. Firstly, Gizzard remembered that Musashi had already sent scouts to the area and their findings were that all of the inhabitants had suddenly disappeared. Therefore, if they did decide to venture the swamps, there was no guarantee that they would see a friendly face or even a face at all. Additionally, the eastern regions of Australis were considered in total enemy control and so crossing into the enemy territory now would be a fool’s venture. Lastly, they would need a way to cross the Yarrum river in the first place. Where were they going to get a boat now that Windar was taken? ", "-It was becoming apparent that the party had no choice but to continue on to the Badlands. They were adamant that the great rift above the ruined city of Addadale was the key to victory against the demons. Dig did a short rousing speech to the party. He said to them that they were never going to win by conventional means and that no matter what happened, he would lead them all to victory if they would just believe in him again. Even hard-hearted Wah’ter let himself believe that there was still hope.", "-As the party continued to mull about the fire, they noticed that their wizard Tim was transfixed in thought. They asked him if he would share his thoughts with the party as he was usually quite insightful. What’s more, now that the party’s primary focus was the rifts, Tim’s recurring visions throughout their journey together may prove extremely beneficial now. How much did Tim really know and how much was he willing to divulge to them? Tim regaled to them a tale which he had heard during his studies on ancient civilisations- the creation story of the Addadale elves. It was said that long, long ago in what was now known as the Badlands, a flourishing civilisation thrived. The elves here were of a different stock to the elves of today. They were more slender, ethereal, almost godly in appearance and were said to live extremely long lives. They had achieved almost everything imaginable under the sun and so riskier and riskier endeavours became commonplace as they strived to venture to greater heights with their technology and magic. It was commonly believed that one dayh, in their pursuit of an ultimate truth, a great bang or light appeared and from then on, the city was swallowed by some great power. There was no common agreement amongst historians of what really happened to the great city that it suddenly disappeared over night and even less acceptance of whether the story had any substance whatsoever. All that they had was the ruins of a once mighty civilisation now swept under the sands. ", "-Tim also gave more information on the dreams and visions that he’d been having about the rifts ever since the adventure first started. Most nights he glimpsed upon the rift or at least something to do with it. He would recognise certain people there like Doran or certain landmarks like the ruins of Addadale but he never could recall why he was there or why he was seeing these visions. There was still so much that the wizard didn’t know and couldn’t remember. But he told the party that he had no doubt in his mind that the Great Rift in the Badlands was the key to their success in the future. ", "-Arthalas tried to confide in Wah’ter about the loss of their loves. Arthalas wept for Tyrande and asked Wah’ter how he managed to compose himself when he too was in the same predicament. Wah’ter berated the elf for his emotional weakness and told him that he had to think about everyone else and not just give in to despair. The triton king called the elf selfish and told him to toughen up if he wanted to survive. Arthalas bowed his head in silence to the harsh but true reality of things. Of course deep down, Wah’ter was coping with loss in his own way but he didn’t want to burden the rest of his companions with his emotional baggage.", "-The party prepared themselves to rest for the night. Arthalas and Varrus were both prepared to tough it out in the elements but Tim insisted that they travel to his pocket plane where it would be safer. The rest of the party were relieved as Tim waved his hands about and created the passageway into their safe haven. Inside was the farmstead that Tim had conjured and where their attendants were now residing. Grundle, Maybelline, Majordomo Major and Willy and Wonka greeted their landlords. After the party revealed to them the state of things, most of them retreated to their sections in the manor and grieved for the ones lost. Survivor’s trauma wracked the lot of them.", "-Some of the rooms in the pocket plane were still bare and entire sections of floor and wall were still missing. The party discovered that the contents of this pocket plane were intrinsically linked with Tim himself. Inside this plane there was a raging storm and buckets of rain billowing down onto the grass which was now long and unkempt. The manor itself looked more worn than usual and the colours faded. Tim apologised for this but it wasn’t like there was any better alternatives outside of this realm. At least the party could take some measure of comfort that they could sleep in peace here in their separate rooms. Without much more to do, they each made their way to their beds and tried to enjoy a night’s rest.", "Prophetic Dreams", "-Both Tim and Dig experienced the same dream when they fell asleep that night. They seemed to be inhabiting the very same body but it was only Dig that was able to recompose himself and realise that he was in fact dreaming this. He could feel Tim’s presence but he could not see the wizard anywhere. The two of them could do little except watch what transpired in front of them:", "Dig and Tim find themselves standing amongst robed men in a circle, their hands interlocked with the others and chanting in a language foreign to them. They are within a temple or sanctum of some sort with otherworldly religious iconography, stained glass windows and overbearing, gilded white pillars filling their surroundings. When they look to the left and right they spot peculiar crystalline rock formations. There is a vibrant energy which buzzes within the stone and emits a soothing hum as the mysterious congregation continues in their song. ", "In the middle of them both lies a great stone table made of the same crystalline material as the rocks, carved out with perfection. Impossible by mortal hand. Just now they begin to hear a frenzied scream from behind the congregation. When they turn around to look they spy a young woman being dragged by her feet by other robed men. She thrashes about desperately and digs her nails into the hard ground but this leaves a trail of blood as they scrape against the rocky surface. Dig and Tim cannot see the woman clearly or even understand the tongue of which her pitiful cries echo. But when the robed men force her onto the stone table and tie her down with rope, another figure proceeds forward with a long, hooked blade. ", "That’s when they realise that they ARE that person with the blade. They now stand with this ceremonial dagger pressed firmly against the soft naked skin of the woman’s chest. Tim and Dig struggle in their minds with all their might to divert the steel away but despite their bravest efforts, they feel every sinew and fibre being torn as the blade sinks deep into her breast, blood spilling outwards and her cries violently cut short. ", "As the vision draws to a close, one word is chanted by the group.", "“Anand.” ", "Dig and Tim simultaneously wake up startled in a cold sweat. What did they just witness? Who were they? Before they could commit to thought, they hear Gizzard screaming from the other room and the sound of floorboards being cracked. They jump out of their beds and rush towards the commotion. ", "-Dig pondered to himself about the future. Although the wizard was unaware, Dig knew that they had both had the same vision. He decided that he would bring it up with Tim at a later date. Right now, their immediate concern was the sound coming from Gizzard’s room. What was the lizardman doing?", "Temptation ", "-During their sleep, Gizzard awoke after being stirred by a foreboding presence in his room:", "Gizzard’s snout begins to itch and a primal instinct sends an adrenaline surge throughout his being. Even in his deep slumber he arises with a fury unseen in any mortal man. Immediately he stands up from his bed and reaches for his serpent-tooth hammer. In the dead of night and in the absence of any sound, he could feel a presence lingering close by. Gizzard taps his hammer so that light could radiate in his room but when he does, he watches as the light is consumed by the figure in front of him.", "As if materialising in thin air, a bulky blue husk of a being steps into view. In the darkness, Gizzard can see its pallid blue skin, piercing red eyes and shining, elongated claws…", "Yoshimitsu speaks. His jaws open but do not move and the voice instead is heard in Gizzard’s head. “Brave warrior king, Gizzard of the Arafura Swamplands. Seeing you in flesh is… impressive.”", "“Silly blue man. Come to die?” Gizzard brandishes his hammer.", "Ignoring the threat, Yoshimitsu continues. “You are smarter and more cunning than you let on. A shame your companions fail to see this. If only they could peer inside like I can, they could see all this untapped reservoir of potential….” ", "Gizzard remains silent but continues to edge forward towards the Oni. Yet with every step the lizard man takes, the blue figure seems to elude him.", "“They don’t see what I see. I see in you… power and glory above anyone else in this world. Ah yes… I see it now. Your concern for your peoples moves me. Such duty and courage are very befitting. The Arafura Swamps is what drives you, is it not?”", "Gizzard refuses to speak.", "Now seemingly irritated, Yoshimitsu says, “What is it that the peoples of Arafura desire and respect above all else?”", "“Strength.” Gizzard grunts.", "“Yes. Power. This I could grant to you and more. The people of Australis, of Thera, of all the mortal planes- they have done enough. They have corrupted everything that the Creators gave to us. I was there when it began.” For a moment there looks to be sadness in his eyes. “What I offer to you, Gizzard, is purity. Freedom from the shackles laid down by mankind. Power absolute. None would stand before you.”", "Gizzard swings with his hammer, having heard enough. The hammer harmlessly passes through Yoshimitsu and collides with the floor instead, letting out a resounding crack throughout the manor. “Stupid. Magics. Hate.” ", "“I have offered this to two others that used to travel among your brethren. They were wise. Are you wise?”", "“Gizzard hate magic. Never follow.”", "“You do not realise the gift that I am offering, Gizzard. All you would do is offer your soul to the dark lord for all time and in return, I would make you more powerful than anyone has ever dreamed. Arafura could become the greatest nation for perpetuity.” Yoshimitsu bares his elongated canines. “Make your choice, warrior king.”", "Gizzard lets himself be intoxicated with the thought of timeless power and glory for the briefest of moments. The offer is tempting and sweet. It is something that only a fool would refuse given how dire their plight. But he is brave and he is strong. “I no need help. Swamps bow to no one.”", "“Fool. Your band of heroes are already doomed. Live with the knowledge that you could have prevented the suffering of your people.” Yoshimitsu throws two heads onto the ground in front of him. ", "As they roll onto the floor, the rest of the party finally rush into the room to see a glimpse of the blue Oni. Dig and Tim begin to chant words of magic while Ro’nok, Ubo and Wah’ter reach for their weapons but the ancient demon turns around and flashes a mocking grin before dissipating into thin air. Gizzard throws one more futile swing with his hammer which inevitably misses its mark. ", "Then all that is left is the party and the two heads now on the floor.", "-Wah’ter knelt down to inspect the two heads which had just stopped rolling about. They were caked in blood and rot was beginning to set but their identities were unmistakable. It was Lux and Wolyn. Trembling, Wah’ter reached out slowly with his hand towards what he believed was his sister. The king of Lantanis felt his heart rip in two and his soul consumed with anger and despair, both vying for control of his fragile mind. Tim consulted Barnabus quickly and used his own magic to sense for any sign of Yoshimitsu still lingering in the area. When he could not detect the Oni nearby, he then scrutinised the heads intensely. After his examination, he concluded that the heads were in fact not Wolyn or Lux. They were definitely heads but somehow Yoshimitsu had managed to weave the fabrics of reality in this pocket plane to create them. Wah’ter slammed the ground with his fist and cursed the demon.", "-This was unsettling to the party. Wah’ter and Dig confronted Tim about the security of this plane. How had Yoshimitsu managed to infiltrate it so easily? Tim admitted that he did not know and that now, there was truly no place safe from the grasp of the enemy. Their only recourse would be to continue on and hope to put more distance between them and Windar. They were undoubtedly being tracked and hunted right now by the demons. Time was of the essence. They needed to reach Urulu soon or the last flames of hope would be extinguished. They all returned to their room to get some last bit of sleep but none of them could relax enough to do so. They had a sleepless night and returned to the road soon after.", "Day 2", "The end of the Cronana Freeway ", "-The party continued on after their rest on the Cronana Freeway. Arthalas and Varrus both managed to get a full night’s worth of sleep and were relatively well rested compared to the rest of the group. When they exited their pocket plane, they were reminded that there was no longer a sun to illuminate the land. Covered in eternal darkness, they felt as if they were lost in a perpetual void. The landscape was still that of an arid desert with very scarce vegetation. Vultures were flying overhead, as if waiting for one of them to get weary and drop. Perhaps they would.", "-Dig thought about talking to Tim about the vision but decided that it was not the right time to do so. For a long while, the entire party travelled in silence as they all thought about the road ahead.", "-A few more hours passed of non-eventful travel:", "Varrus rides alongside the two aquans on his ram steed and says. “It’s completely mad, I tell ye. Cannae separate day from night. The world’s gone upside down.” He points up and shakes his head.", "Lord Commander Ubo sips on some water and shrugs. “Ligma.”", "Varrus turns his attention to Wah’ter. “Well, Windar’s gone for good. But your peoples are still headed there. Now I’m no sage but d’you realise what might just happen?”", "Wah’ter says, “I have thought about this, my short legged friend, and I would hope that my people would have enough sense to turn away from the city. You know... once they see the great gaping hole in the sky, smoke, and the apocalypse in general.”", "Tim makes his way towards the small congregation as well. The robed wizard pats his horse. “Easy, girl.” Tim looks up. “How are we all?”", "“Yeah we’re all good, lad.” Varrus responds first. “I find myself in great company. Your friends are a great bunch, no word of a lie.”", "“Yes, well...” Tim casts a glance behind him to spot, just in time, Gizzard’s horse collapsing from exhaustion and dying. The overgrown lizardman does not hesitate to begin butchering the dead steed for meat, which he proceeds to then wrap up in some cloths and load onto Dumbo. “They’re certainly something.”", "Meanwhile Dig rides on his own to the front of the pack, throwing a look over his shoulder periodically. The dragonborn sorcerer is unsure of whether he wants to talk about the vision last night with Tim. He finally decides that now is not the right time to do so and rests his mind.", "Varrus chuckles to himself and downs a significant amount from his flask. “Look over there at Arthalas.” He points lazily with his free hand at the dilapidated ranger. “Poor lad. Imagine what he’s going through.”", "“I don’t need to imagine it.” The triton king looks over to the elf with disinterest. “The elf needs to get a grip on himself. He’s so worthless.”", "“Eh don’t you think you’re being a wee harsh there, lad?”", "“The elf smells like all the rest. He reeks of fear and uncertainty.”", "“That’s probably me!” Ubo giggles.", "“You’re not really being fair, Wahter,” Tim says. “What reason do you even have for hating elves?”", "“Because...” Wah’ter really digs deep for this one. “You know.”", "“No I don’t?”", "“Well Lantanis... like... and plus... the elves are um... so...”", "The DM appears perplexed. “Bro there’s literally like no reason for your character to have such a profound hatred for elves like please give my poor NPC a chance :(”", "Wah’ter scratches his head. “Does anyone else here that voice?”", "Somewhere on some screen, a penis is drawn.", "Varrus clear his throat. “Aye he’s taking it very hard but you know... maybe one of you should go over and help the man?” The dwarf is clearly suggesting something.", "Wah’ter closes his eyes and sighs. “If I must.” ", "The triton slows his pace until he rides alongside Arthalas. The elf in question is trailing behind everyone in the group, even further back than Gizzard who has decided to jog at the rear. Arthalas sits atop of his unicorn mount without a word and the ghost of a man barely even registers Wah’ter’s presence.", "“Hey elf.” Wah’ter waves.", "The once brilliant blue eyes of this elf are now dull and lifeless. “Ishnu-alah.” ", "Wah’ter rubs his forehead. “Look there, pal. I know it’s hard but you’re not the only one in your situation.”", "The corners of the elf’s mouth crease. “I didn’t sleep last night, my friend.”", "“Friend? What the fu-”", "“Tyrande, my dearest love, would not stop screaming. I could see her, as clear as I see you now, being torn apart by the foul demonspawn, reaching to me and calling… calling for me.” ", "“That sounds pretty rough.” Wah'ter can't help but wonder if his own Wolyn suffered the same thing too.", "“She was my shan’do, teacher, and I was her thero’shan, student. She taught me how to live my life, how to see the good in others. She was kind and gentle and they…” His voice trails off as he stares off to some other place.", "Now Wah’ter has had enough of sob stories and especially Arthalas feeling sorry for himself. “Just toughen up you bloody princess. It’s only going to get harder from here. If this stops you, then you have no choice. Just give up if all you're going to do is whine and complain. Do you think Tyrande would want to see what a pathetic excuse of a man you've become.”", "“I-”", "“You want to give up and die? Then do it. But don't drag the rest of us down with you, buddy.” ", "These words rock Arthalas to the core and it is apparent that he is mentally defeated by Wah’ter’s response.”You are right. Tonight I shall return to the World Tree and be reunited with my love. It is my decision. Please do not tell the others.”", "“You... yeah you do that.” Wah’ter takes his leave. He does feel a little guilty but what is said is said.", "Tim is luckily within earshot of this conversation and mutters under his breath, “Oh, shit. Here we go.”", "As Arthalas resolves himself to taking his own life, Tim decides it is time to come over to offer counsel to the distraught man. ", "-Wah’ter didn’t do anything wrong really. If this was a Bioware game back when they were competent, then it might’ve actually helped to harden Arthalas up. Unfortunately the delivery was maybe a bit too harsh and so Arthalas was quite adamant in killing himself. Elves man...", "-Tim took it upon himself to lift Arthalas’ spirits. He reasoned with Arthalas that from now on, only more deaths were going to happen and that Windar was only the first. If Arthalas wanted to save Australis and his people, then he would need to continue on the quest and get to the bottom of the great rift in the ancient elven kingdom. The elf’s sense of duty and honour overcame his grief and despair. Arthalas promised that he would persist, to the end of the quest, at the very least", "-An interesting question here is how much did Tim the Enchanter really care for Arthalas’ wellbeing? Did the wizard choose to save Arthalas because he felt a genuine moral obligation to do so? Or was it because Arthalas was the only elf they had with them and his knowledge would be invaluable once they entered the elven ruins of Addadale? ", "Camping", "-They eventually set up camp again. The party wanted to crash in the pocket portal again like last night but because of the disturbed sleep that Tim had gotten, he was too exhausted to cast the spell again. Sadly, they would have to sleep in the elements tonight. ", "-While Arthalas went to gather some food for the night and other supplies, the party sat around the campfire and listened to Varrus talking about his home of Urulu. He described the city in great detail, talked about the gigantic cavernous tunnel systems and ancient cave networks that even the dwarves themselves long abandoned, about the dark and mysterious beasts that roamed the subterranean world that they faced, their politics and attitudes of the people.", "-It was becoming very clear that there was a strong anti-human sentiment amongst the dwarves. Apparently the dwarves were said to have been tall and strong (picture a Qunari from DA) when they used to live on the surface. It was only when the first men sailed to Australis from the East that they were forced to live underground where they would then slowly turn into the race that they are today. Did they bear a grudge? The majority of them, definitely. Varrus explained that the Uruluans (name in progress) had a book called the Dammaz Kron where they detailed every one that had wronged the dwarven people. Humans happened to be number one on their list. Tim gulped.", "-I honestly can’t remember the specific details that Varrus talked about. Pretty sure he mentioned that Urulu (the mountain) was home to their city also called Urulu, but that there used to be many other ancient cities that were underground and spanned all over Australis. But of course as the resources and things like that began to dwindle, and other horrors (we will learn in upcoming sessions that the dwarves were also affected by the demons) forced them into abandoning these colonies. The next session will be in Urulu where we can really explore the city. I mean, that’s if the dwarves even allow people entrance into the city itself. Or if even there are any dwarves left ;) Find out next week in the next episode of Last Dragon Z!", "-Alright anyway, Varrus talks about the Obsidian Gate and how it was said to be created by the gods or something along those lines. Apparently the majority of Urulu was already there, or at least the shell of the city was. It was made from this glorious material that looked like a mix between jade and emerald. It looked alive. (I didn’t mention it during the session, but it’s called Dara in the dwarven tongue, meaning Living Rock. The dwarves will talk more about it next week. Let’s see who actually reads these recaps: Whoever says “Dara” first gets a miracle point and an earlier level up). For a sneak preview on the look of the city, I’m going for like a steampunk + warcraft + industrial forgeworld + futuristic shit cos of their trading with the addadale elves back in the day sort of look. Open to suggestions. Don’t know how I’m going to pull that off but should be fun xd", "-Wah’ter took a liking to Varrus and wondered why more of the people they met couldn’t be like him. Wah’ter asked Varrus about his combat capabilities and whether they could spar. Varrus seemed up for it but Dig told them both off like a responsible mum. Dig said it would be too noisy. Would’ve been really wholesome but Dig had to go and be sensible :(", "Day 3", "The Mysterious Hut", "-Once again, everyone set off back on the road. Another few hours of travel and the sky was still black and suffocating, air smelling like sulphur and brimstone and starting to hurt etc. The atmosphere was actually so painful for some that it caused them actual harm, that being Tim who was unaccustomed to to this much physical strain.", "Eventually the Cronana Freeway fades away and is swept underneath sand and dirt. The scenery changes from dry desert sands to a rocky, mountainous landscape. A few gigantic, sequoia trees dot the skyline Varrus assures everyone that this means that they are only another couple of days out from Urulu proper. ", "Dumbo doesn’t seem to be used to the scraggy, rugged terrain and has slowed down markedly whereas Auron seems unaffected. If anything, it looks like Auron is enjoying this change. There’s something about dragons and mountains. There are also sparse outcrops of shrubbery and foliage here and there but the heroes find mostly cold rock. Is it night or day? How long has it been since you left Windar? ", "Soon, something catches the attention of both Tim and Wah’ter, who are riding near the vanguard. A hidden track that they didn’t notice before comes into view out of seemingly nothing. Then what looks like a thick mist emerges and shrouds this area in the distance. Barely, just barely, the two of them can make out the outline of some small hut. Signs of life here in this harsh terrain? Wah’ter cautiously moves forward towards the mist on his horse but every time he blinks, he somehow loses its location and has to refocus again.", "Tim tries to consult Barnabus but yet again, the babbling book continues to spout nonsense and gibberish. “What’s going on here?”", "Varrus eventually catches up to those in front. “What’re ye lot lookin’ at?”", "Tim grimaces. “I’m not quite sure of that myself, actually.”", "“There’s something there.” Wah’ter dismounts his horse and gestures to Varrus what he and Tim have been seeing this whole time. “It’s right there.”", "“Are you pullin’ me beard?” Varrus does not have a strand of hair on his face. “There’s nothing out here except stone and rocks.” Varrus gulps down another generous amount of ale from his flask. “Nope, still nothin’.”", "When the rest of the party arrives, Tim and Wah’ter both explain their sighting of the mysterious hut in the fog. None of the other companions can see it however and they are initially skeptical. However, because the two of them seem so adamant, they decide on their course of action. ", "Dig checks the Eye of Melora hanging from his neck. He looks confused. The light from his amulet usually shone a brilliant green when it detected illusory magic but at the moment, it was a gentle purple glow. “I don’t really like this, boys.”", "“We. Go. I. Strong. No. Problem.” Gizzard raises his hammer and begins walking forward into the mist.", "Wah’ter and Tim lead the way. Ro’nok and Ubo soon follow. The rest of the entourage remains behind in waiting. Dig is last to go and waits next to Auron. ", "The dragon whispers in the sorcerer’s mind. “Where are they going?”", "“We are about to find out, I think.” Dig readies a few spells. “Stay behind me, Auron.”", "When Tim arrives at the foot of this fog, Barnabus struggles at his clasps. The wizard unfastens them and Barnabus begins to yell incessantly. The only intelligible words came towards the end. “Magic, magic, powerful, old! Dangerous? Not sure. Friendly? Yes? No? Both? Unknown! Up to you, Magister.”", "Tim slowly puts Barnabus away as he cautiously meanders forward. “Well then...” ", "-The party travelled into this mist one by one. There was something that tried to push them back multiple times and it was a mental struggle to persist. However, all of the party was able to resist these mental blocks and they emerged at the other side. Dig, who had been still checking his Eye of Melora avidly, was unsure of what to expect.", "Pushing passed the haze of confusion the heroes find themselves at the doorsteps of an abandoned shack and immediately hear the sweetest song. It is a tune from a lost time, speaking of love, regret, sorrow and hope. It is warm and cold, depressing and cheerful. It looks to be coming from a lone figure gently tugging at the strings of a harp. When they hear this enchanting melody, they momentarily forget about all their troubles and pain.", "The figure is a woman clothed in a simple cotton dress with a faded pink rose dangling in her silver locks. A purple tribal tattoo is clearly visible against the backdrop of her fair and smooth skin. But those ears are unmistakable. They are pointed at the top and more elongated than a humans and she bears near-supernatural features.", "“An elf?” Dig mutters in disbelief.", "“There’s something different about this one.” Tim warily approaches her.Upon closer examination, it is apparent that she is an elf, but not quite like the ones that the party have seen before. She looks as if she’s glowing, like a golden aura is surrounding her and making her glisten in the moonlight. She is almost unsubstantial and ethereal, not really here. Not really.", "Gizzard trudges up the steps and leans in extremely close to the woman’s face. “HELLO?”Wah’ter, Tim, Ubo and Ro’nok each go forward to greet her but for some reason she does not seem to respond.", "“She’s in another world, this one.” Wah’ter claps his hands together. “Is she asleep or something?”", "“No. I think she may be blind,” Tim replies.", "Dig has held back the entire time in case of any hostile intents. The Eye of Melora flares purple once more and this is when the elven woman stops her tune. She slowly looks up, as if waking up from a trance, and gasps. “Tel’amulet ath Addadale.... va tel’ siilen sal amin ten’nesh?”", "“I’m sorry.” Dig shakes his head. “I do not speak... whatever that language is.”She repeats again. ", "“I-” Dig turns to Ro’nok. “A little help here, buddy. You have a spell for this don’t you?”", "Ro’nok nods. “Yeah, mate I gotcha.” The paladin prays to his god and an aura of understanding washes over the party.", "This time, when the woman speaks to them, they comprehend the tongue. “The amulet of Addadale. Who are you?”", "Dig answers in Common and Ro’nok’s magic translates his meaning across. “My name is Dig Bickman and these are my friends. The amulet I will get to later. But first, who are you?”", "She frowns at him with a puzzled expression. “My name? I... I had a name I think. Once. But I cannot recall it.”Tim says, “Where are you from?”", "“I am from,” she stares at the amulet, “that place. I remember an amulet, robed men, sadness and then...” She looks up at the wizard suddenly recalling. “Addadale.”", "The party stands in shocked silence, none certain of how to proceed. Tim tries to press her for more information. “Do you remember anything? Anything at all?”", "The elven woman shakes her head. “It feels like a dream. Every night I wake up and I find myself here in this place. This lonely place.”", "“And what do you dream of?”", "“I dream of robed men, a woman's screams, a bloody knife and cold walls. Addadale crying. And pain... such terrible pain.”", "Tim's eyes widen. “This dream. It sounds like-”", "“I had the same dream, Tim.” Dig interrupts the wizard. “We will talk about it more later. It must have some sort of importance.”", "The woman stands up from her chair. “I... I remember a promise made a long time ago. When I see the amulet of my people, I remember this. Please, come inside. We will talk more.”", "Gizzard snarls. “Trap. Bad. Lady.”", "Only when the rest of the party accompanies the harpist inside does the lizardman slowly follow suit. ", "“What in the world is going on?” Wah'ter wonders with bated breath.", "The Black Box", "-The hut was nothing out of the ordinary. It was well preserved, if anything. The architecture something between human and elven, and then on top of that a tinge of something else. Ancient or new they couldn’t tell. Where were they? It was dark and cold outside and inside it was just as poor. Seeing this, the woman:", "The woman rests her harp against a table and sits herself by the fireplace. She extends her hands and rummages around in a small chest for some kindling and smaller logs. The blind girl frowns upon realising that she is all out.", "Dig hangs his admiral’s jacket on a rack and then with a click of his fingers, a vibrant flame begins to sizzle in the fireplace. ", "If the woman is surprised, she doesn’t show it. Instead, she says. “Sit. Doubtless you have questions. I will tell you what I know.”", "-In summary, they didn’t learn an awful lot from her. Despite all of their prompts, it was obvious that she had no recollection of who she was, how she got here or even why she was here in the first place. However, they did stumble upon some interesting findings. Unfortunately, most of these were cryptic and had them even more confused than they initially were. ", "-Gizzard was going to rob her blind (haha get it?) Gizzard went to the kitchen cupboards and found himself an ornamental spoon with strange engravings on it. There didn’t seem to be anything else of value so after he made sure that the tenant wasn’t looking, he pocketed the spoon in his... well I guess he pocketed in his loincloth. ", "-Tim quickly deduced from her that she was not from this time. Tim enquired of her if she remembered there being any dragons where she was from. The woman almost chuckled, unsure of why he would ask such a thing. She explained that the dragons were numerous and that they ruled the very skies and that they were worshipped as gods. This meant that she had to be from a time when dragons still ruled Australis. This basically confirmed that she was an elf from Addadale. But who was she? Was she important? She clearly knew of the amulet at least, if that meant anything.", "-She couldn’t remember anything of Addadale, save that it was beautiful. The last things she remembered before she ended up in this place was being dragged kicking and screaming by robed men who thrust her upon a table before she blacked out. Tim and Dig weren’t sure of what to make of this. The implication was that this woman was the one that they had the vision of. Why did they see this particular vision and what significance did this have on the future? More questions yet again which she could not answer at this stage", "-What she could offer, however, was delivering on the promise that she remembered making once upon a time. When the party asked her about this promise she strode over to the chest and produced to them a black box. It wasn’t special looking or anything like that. It looked to be a simple black box made of a material similar to granite. Yet on the box they saw seven strange impressions which they figured represented them. They then learnt that Doran the Explorer had visited her before as well and was the one that handed her this box and the gem:", "An impression in the shape of three claw swipes (Gizzard)", "An impression in the shape of a fireball/comet (Tim)", "An impression in the shape of a dragon’s head (Dig)", "An impression in the shape of a trident (Wah’ter) ", "An impression in the shape of a tortle shell (Ubo) ", "An impression in the shape of an oval (Ro’nok)", "An impression in the shape of a cross with something like a gem encrusted in it (Doran/Jesus)", "-She said that the box would open many doors for them. (They would eventually see the irony in this). Unfortunately she had no idea as to what the box did and equally no response as to when Doran gave her this box. In any case, Dig decided to safeguard the box and to keep it safe. Whatever this thing was, it was clearly meant for them by someone or something", "-After receiving the box, the woman herself suddenly felt a veil lift from her eyes. She smiled and at once felt elation. She claimed to be seeing a purifying light in the distance and was reaching out to it. She shot a look at the party, unsure of what to do but Tim encouraged her, telling her to venture towards this light. She looked to be bathed in this holy light and the room was filled with this love and warmth. Before their eyes, the woman faded away gently into nothingness. All that remained behind was her harp. As they stood around in the room, completely dumbfounded of what they had just witnessed, the walls of the hut were starting to disappear as well. Wah’ter took the harp, the only thing that remained, and the rest of the party quickly exited the room", "-The next thing they realised, they were riding on their horses next to Arthalas and Varrus once more. Had this all been a dream? Arthalas and Varrus were confused because they had apparently been travelling this whole time and did not recall there being a mist or a mysterious hut. It couldn’t have a been a dream right? Dig checked his persons and took out the black box. The party sighed in relief and they decided to set up camp for the night.", "Purification trials", "-At camp they played around with the black box. They tried magic first but when Dig and Tim failed to achieve a single thing through magical identification, they decided they needed to come up with another plan. I’m sure that if Ubo, the strongest mage in the party, decided to have a crack he would open it no problem.", "-They tried brute strength. Gizzard used every ounce of his being to pry this thing open but to no avail. Wah’ter decided he’d do the same thing but was met with similar results. This box didn’t even look that sturdy yet it was resisting incredible levels of pressure. Whatever material it was made of, it was not from this plane.", "-They had no idea what to do with the thing and were about to give up. Out of nowhere, they decided that they’d take the black bible out to see if perhaps it’d offer any insight. When they took the infernal text out, the book began to disintegrate. It burst into flame upon being in the presence of this box. Next, they decided to take Bronyl’s head out, which subsequently burst into flame too. Wah’ter showed surprisingly little guilt when his brother’s head underwent spontaneous combustion. This gave Wah’ter and a Dig an idea. They surmised that because Barnabus had been acting so strange lately, that he was perhaps a demon in disguise or consorting with the enemy", "-Tim trusted Barnabus but even if he couldn’t argue that this was a brilliant idea. Of course, there was no way that Barnabus could be...", "-They tested the babbling book and to their relief, he was fine. In fact, upon being exposed to this black box, Barnabus began crying and asking if there was no other way. He sounded like he was talking to someone that he was madly in love with or respected. But that was all they were going to get from the black box. Only time now would tell what exactly they had got their hands on", "Day 4", "The Old Road ", "-The party began to ascend some rocky hills and it becomes more of a mountain climb than a walk. Eventually they reached the beginning of a new track. Oxygen levels continue to decrease. ", "-They arrived at a road of stone and gravel that cut in between two towering mountain peaks, their tips not visible from this height. The distant calls of the wilderness echoed down the valley:", "Dumbo is feeling the most strain due to the burdensome scorpion carapace armour and the weeks’ worth of supplies he is carrying on himself. At least Auron is in better spirits, seemingly at home in this mountainous terrain. Auron sometimes finds some poor small squirrels in some of the nooks and crannies of the mountain faces and torches them before snacking on their charred remains.", "Varrus stops in his tracks, patting his mountain ram. “We finally made it. Well, not Urulu but we’re getting’ close laddies. This right here that we’re standing on is the Old Road.” He points to the grand path laid out before everyone. It cuts in between these two towering mountains and forms a valley about thirty metres across between the both of the mountains’ bases. “The Old Road was here before the Freeway was ever constructed. Back before my people were driven out by the first men, we used to have a network of roads all over Australis. We were quite the artisans.” He appears quite pleased with this.", "“We’re getting close,” Dig says.", "Arthalas sits impatiently on his unicorn. “How long until we reach the city now, Varrus?”", "The dwarf scratches his beardless chin. “Usually I’d say another two hours or so in good light but we’re goin’ to be slowed down a wee bit on account of this darned blackness. How many more supplies we got in here?”", "“Supplies. Plenty.” Gizzard gives a hearty slap on Dumbo’s rear.", "“We’re basically there.” Varrus bites his lip. “I should warn you all though. The Old Road is no longer as safe as it used to be. Used to be that the Outriders would go and patrol the road but since we’re now busy in the war, I’m sure that common bandits and mountain beasts prolly roam the area. Keep a close eye for each other.”", "“They should watch out for us.” Wah’ter says in his abomination form. His tone is confident. ", "Ubo nods enthusiastically. ", "-Tim and Wah’ter volunteered to scout the area ahead before they proceeded in case of any shenanigans by the enemy. They were certain that they’d placed a fair distance between them and the pursuing demons, but you could never be too safe. Tim used the shapeshifting powers that he had been given by Yurtruz the orc shaman from a year back. His form shifted into that of a majestic falcon. Next, Dig used his polymorph spell in order to transform Wah’ter into, and this was per the triton king’s request, a rat. A 1hp rat. Rah’ter leapt onto the falcon-formed Tim’s back and the dynamic duo soared off into the night skies ahead. The rest of the party silently rode on into the valley.", "-Continuing on from the perspective of the two scouts, they flew for around thirty minutes and saw very little in the way of an ambush. There was no way for Tim to fly to the top of the mountain peaks without the cold killing Rah’ter- nor was there much point really as any potential attackers would be much too far away to pose a serious threat to their group. However, that is when Tim with his razor-sharp vision, spotted something at the very end of this valley. There was a wall of some sort blocking the only exit out of the Old Road. The falcon looked ahead and could see the grand Urulu mountain in the distance, a great stone bridge over an extremely long chasm. They were so close! It was only this strange wall that seemed to be an obstacle. The two of them flew in closer to have a better look at what they were dealing with:", "The wall is around fifteen metres high and thirty metres across, completely blocking the road forward. The wind carries with it this fetid, putrid smell which sallies forward into Tim and Wah’ter’s nostrils. It is the familiar spell of death and decay. When the two reach the base of this wall, the terrible truth sets in. This wall is not made of mortar and bricks but instead, piled upon each other are bodies upon bodies of men, women and children in various stages of decomposition. Festering sores and rotten carcasses litter the Old Road, scraps of flesh and appendages sagging off these corpses due to them being in the sun for so long, like they’d melted. Maggots squirm and tunnel their way in and out of their newly formed pores as flies and beetles circle the great feast prepared for them. ", "-Wah’ter leaps off Tim’s back and reverts back into his triton form. Just before landing in the wall of flesh he transformed himself into his abomination form and collided into the sacks of meat. He spent the rest of the time, while the rest of his party made their way towards their position, disposing the bodies and clearing a hole in the wall. Thankfully, his abomination blood prevented him contracting deadly disease.", "-Meanwhile, with the rest of the party:", "Varrus exclaims. “Haha! We’re almost there now lads keep it up. After we exit this valley we’ll come across a bridge which leads into the front entrance of our home. You’ll love the darned place, I swear. It’s been centuries since an outsiders even glimpsed upon the Obsidian Door, and that’s just the front entrance!”", "Dig nods. “Not here for sightseeing but-”", "“That’s not even inside, imagine a millennia of terraformin’ beneath the surface, caverns that stretch beyond your wildest imaginations, hidden tunnels and cave networks that you’d never explore in several lifetimes. And the cities, marvels of mastercrafted dwarven engineering fused with dashes of inspiration from ancient elven relics from the Badlands.” ", "Arthalas is disinterested and continues on. “Let us go.” ", "Arthalas stops dead in his tracks. Dig and Gizzard catch up and realise why. They see Wah’ter in the middle of moving bodies from this gruesome wall.", "“Hey,” Wah’ter says as he dumps another disembodied arm into the pile.Before they can process anything, out of nowhere a low pitched hum begins to fill the air. Some of the loose rocks on the road begin to float in mid-air and the mountains start to rumble. It becomes increasingly stronger before it’s almost like a low magnitude earthquake. Dumbo gets agitated and begins to trample around which in turn causes the horses to stir. ", "“What is going on?” Arthalas screams as he struggles to control his unicorn. Then, panicked, Auron sends a message through all your heads. “They’re here!”", "Out of nowhere, behind the party about a hundred metres back, a bluish purple haze begins to materialise and one by one, green hellfire begins to swirl madly and form gaping holes in reality. Portals burst open and demons pour forth. A maniacal, high pitched laughter echoes down the valley as Yoshimitsu steps out and points a finger at your party.", "He speaks in the Abyssal tongue. “Thok, ozh childr'ahm!” And the demon host charges forward. ", "“Run!” Dig roars as the party charges through the breach.", "The Chase Encounter", "-The battle was essentially the party rushing towards the great obsidian gate. The obsidian gate was the entrance to the dwarven kingdom of Urulu and if what Varrus said was true, it would be a powerful magical barrier that could potentially save them from their pursuers. The problem was that they were extremely far out. Tim had already flown ahead into the front of the mountain in order to do some scouting. ", "-Everyone except for Tim came across the great stone bridge where they were being chased. Each one of the party members were assaulted by a demon and all of them managed to shrug off their attacker, barely escaping and continuing on the bridge. Now at this point of the chase, their mounts had been attacked and brutally slain by the demons (except for Ro’nok’s) and so they were on foot and dashing over this bridge to get to the other side. ", "-Arthalas was caught by one of the lunar demons and was sent crashing to the ground. Gizzard and Dig looked over their shoulder behind them and were caught in a terrible situation. If they stopped to help the elf, they would surely perish. There was nothing that they could do and so they continued to sprint forwards. Tim, however, was prepared. Still in his falcon form, the wizard accelerated towards the bridge with blinding speed and transformed back into his human shape as he descended. He landed on the bridge on one knee and got Arthalas up to his knees. He nodded to the elf and muttered words of magic before the both of them were misty stepped to the rest of the crowd. ", "-Another thing was that when they did attempt to cross the bridge, they realised that Dumbo could not possibly travel across it efficiently enough. If Dig had not polymorphed Dumbo into a raven, the elephant would have perished too. Dig instructed Auron to take flight. The golden dragon did so and soared high into the air over the bridge.", "-The rest of the battle was carnage. When they arrived on the other side of the bridge, there was still a fair amount of distance to the Obsidian Gate. In front of them on the floor were dead dwarves who looked to be freshly slain. At the same time, multiple portals opened in front of them at the location that they were headed towards. There were not only demons here but also orcs and goblins- specifically the Nilbogs which the party encountered a long, long time ago. This wasn’t going to be an epic battle but rather a struggle for survival. The only thing that mattered now was reaching the Obsidian Gate. What happened afterwards would be up to the gods", "-Gizzard did the most selfish- but probably smartest- thing. He brushed past all of his companions and used his incredible speed to run past the portals which were opening right next to him, ducking under spears and magical bolts as he thundered across the field. He would eventually reach the door first. The lizardman was no dummy and he quickly worked out that there was an impression in the Obsidian Gate the same shape and size as the black box. He looked behind him past the enemies and saw that the rest of his companions were still struggling to make it up. He shouted for the box in desperation", "-Auron breathed flames all over the enemy and incinerated anyone in his way as he soared across the skies. Before Tim crossed the bridge he actually tripped over. He was a wizard and definitely not up to par fitness-wise to the rest of his companions. Tim mounted onto Auron’s back and the two were a force to be reckoned with. If Dig was going to be jealous, this wouldn’t be the time. Tim flew forwards with Auron, shooting fireballs onto masses of enemies while Auron did the same with his dragon breath. The multiple spells and ranged missiles shooting for the two of them made their flight path weird and slowed them down considerably. But their determination would shoot them through to reach the Obsidian Gate.", "-Dig meanwhile had been caught halfway through by one of the nilbogs cleverly hiding on an overlooking ridge. The Nilbog cast a terrifying spell which caused Dig to double over in laughter. The dragonborn struggled to overcome the intense elation that was coursing through his entire being. Amidst his laughing fit he watched as behind him, Arthalas, Wah’ter, Ubo and Ro’nok were in considerable danger. Varrus also made it to Dig’s position where he too fell victim to another nilbog’s spell. The two of them literally rofl’d together.", "-Wah’ter lifted Varrus up into the skies and initiated an assault on the enemy. Varrus let out some volley fire in the air and Wah’ter found himself impaling a cultist with his trident, forcing him against the ground. Wah’ter in his bloodlust, ripped out another cultist’s spine and chewed on it in delight. Then of course he got gangbanged by about thirty demons which absolutely wailed on him. Note for all you aspiring dungeoneers, do not tempt the DM with statements like “I can basically never die lol”. ;) ;) ;) ;)", "-Nah that wasn’t the reason why, it was just bad luck that most of the concentration of the enemy were at their position. It also didn’t help that Ro’nok and Ubo weren’t there in person so I was inefficiently using their characters- as in I didn’t use any abilities. When Wah’ter found himself at the mercy of a pitfiend, this was when things really started to go south. Yoshimitsu was also ominously walking towards his prone body", "-Wah’ter looked at Ubo who, with his short stumpy legs, had no way of outrunning the pursuers. He nodded to the lord commander and Ubo knew what he had to do. The tortle unleashed all of his elemental might and electricity surged throughout the vicinity. All lesser demons were instantaneously fried and even the stronger amongst them were momentarily stunned. For several minutes the tortle sent surges of electricity and killing scores of demons. But as this was happening, allies were falling too. Ro’nok was trying to make his way back to the downed Wah’ter in order to get him up but the great gusts of wind and bolts of lightning were forcing him away. With little choice, Ro’nok continued towards the door on his own", "-Arthalas actually tried to rescue Wah’ter but was caught at the last second by another pit fiend and lost consciousness next to him. It was an admirable effort which moved Wah’ter but regardless, it would not be enough. Ubo lost consciousness as the last of his power faded and all three of them were now at the mercy of the demons. Yoshimitsu was approaching and some of the demons prepared for the coup de grace.", "-The deathblows would never come. All of a sudden a great divine light rushed through the fields and ravaged every single demon. All of the enemies that were still standing (there was still quite a considerable amount despite all the fireballs, fire breaths, electricity, and steel flashing about) were either vapourised or stunned. Yoshimitsu itself had to turn away and shield his eyes from this beautiful light. Where was it coming from? ", "-It turned out that the box had miraculously reached its location. When Tim and Auron arrived at Gizzard’s location, the lizardman explained that they needed the box. Tim had forgotten that it was Dig who was holding the black box and not himself. The wizard looked behind them and saw Dig beside himself with laughter. After a heroic flight towards the sorcerer, Tim retrieved the ring from the dragonborn. Dig had only just managed to break out of the spell’s trance and place the ring into Tim’s grasp. Once the black box was placed into the Obsidian Gate, this caused the great blinding light to save everyone’s asses. Every single one of the party members was pulled to the Obsidian Gate as if some divine wind was carrying them. This was absolutely clutch because Wah’ter was only inches away from death. ", "-Unfortunately, there was still the matter of Arthalas and Varrus. The Black Box reaction did not affect them in any way whatsoever. This was a dire situation. Of the party remaining, only Tim, Gizzard and Dig were in any condition to put up resistance against the enemy (who were now slowly recovering from the light shock). The Obisidan Gate was slowly opening and all they would have to do is rush inside to safety. Would they abandon Arthalas and Varrus in order to save themselves?", "-Not today, Tim rode in with Auron like a true hero. The aerial manouevres that the duo pulled off was unbelievable. It was like Tim had ridden a dragon since birth. As the enemy continued to assault them, they flew overhead and rained death from above. Tim managed to not only pick up Varrus and Arthalas on the way, but Auron managed to pull off a barrel roll that let them lose no time at all. Pit demons reached out to grab Auron but due to Tim’s expert handling, they barely escaped with their lives intact. Then the last scare came from Varrus who was still caught in the clutch of the laughing spell. He kicked this way and that, almost knocking Tim off his saddle. Normally the wizard had no sense of balance but in this moment of darkness, he shone bright, and hung on for dear life. They crashed into the front of the Obsidian Gate and flew through. Dig and Gizzard dragged the rest of their companions inside where the door slammed shut. And then all was silent.", "TO BE CONTINUED"]

The enigmatic black box follows soon after, crashing to the ground and tumbling about, sending rumbling echoes into the spacious, hollow cavern that they find themselves in. ", "Then silence…Those who were knocked out now slowly stir as the rest search earnestly for a source of light, a glimmer of something to illuminate the surroundings. Dig clambers to his feet and feels the cold earth underneath his hand as he hoists himself up. The air is stale on his skin and the unsettling chill wind permeates through his being. ", "“Well, shit.” The dragonborn says as he fumbles around in the dark.", "Arthalas, even with his own enhanced sight, does the same. “My vision fails me. Is everyone alright? Are we safe in here?”", "“Safe is a dangerous word,” Tim says.", "The triton king glances around. “Not even worried.”", "Varrus takes a swig of mead from his seemingly inexhaustible flask. He swirls it around in his hand and grumbles, “I cannae see a damn thing in this shite. Anyone care to shine a wee bit of light around here?”", "Dig casts a bonfire on the ground which prompts Ubo to utilise Wah’ter’s head as a dome for his own light spell. These beacons of light burst into life, particularly that of the abomination’s head, which allows them to better survey their surroundings. It appears that Urulu is rich in igneous rock, which comprises the bulk of what they see. Small coiling veins of lava seep in between cracks of the walls and floor. The roof itself looks as if it as high up as the sky outside and like rain, water droplets drip from monstrously overgrown stalactites hanging precariously up above.", "Arthalas picks up a stone from the ground that looks like an emerald or jade and says, “What is this ore we keep seeing around us? I wasn’t aware that the mountain had such materials.”", "Dig and Tim immediately recognise this ore from their recent visions. The temple in your dream was made from this material- that same lustrous sheen and brilliant energy, as if life was encased within its walls. ", "Dig shifts uncomfortably. “A living rock. Seems like something a dwarf would use.”", "Varrus nods affirmatively. “Aye, you’ll be right about that. We call it Dara. My people brought it from the ruins of Addadale. All their buildings are made of that stuff... well that and something akin to polished white marble.” He smacks his lips. “The smiths love making jewellery out of it but ugh, I’d never touch it. It’s like a soul is trapped inside. Bad omens if you ask me.”", "Wah’ter seems intrigued by the stone and picks up another. Despite his keen eye, he cannot discern much from it. Undoubtedly it is a rock too vibrant to be inert. But a soul? Probably not. ", "Right?", "Everyone in the party save for Gizzard and Wah’ter feel slightly weakened. Auron’s golden scales also seem a little duller than usual and not just because of the lack of light. The winds of magic are weak here.", "“Great,” Tim mutters under his breath. He checks on Barnabus to see that he too has gotten weary.", "Arthalas clears his throat. “We should move while we still can. The Obsidian Gates are sturdy but I doubt they’re as impenetrable as the tales claim.”", "“Hmph.” Gizzard taps on his hammer so that sparks of radiant energy fly off. “Let’s go.”", "-Auron was calm but clearly shaking. The party moved forward with Dig tending to Auron best that he could. Dumbo was now returned to his normal form and travelling beside them. The party was clearly worn from their escape from Yoshimitsu’s clutches and it showed on their faces and bodies. Thankfully, their golden dragon breathed holiness onto them and their spirit was renewed. ", "-They get about fifty metres away from the great Obsidian Gates when: ", "Three deafening blows ring out from the Obsidian Gates. This gets their attention. Ro’nok and Gizzard both reach for their hammers instinctively while turning towards the sounds.", "But then a weak voice comes from the other side of the door. “Wah’ter…”", "The party all fall silent. They watch as Wah’ter’s eyes widen and he closes in for the black doors, fast. Ubo, knowing full well how far his king would go, leaps onto the ten foot abomination and tries to pull him back. However, being only five foot himself, he is only able to get his arms around Wah’ter’s legs, being dragged along the ground against his will. ", "There is quiet sobbing. “Wah’ter, it’s me, Wolyn. I- I’m scared.”", "“I’m coming, Wolyn!” Wah’ter screams, veins bulging out of his well-developed quadriceps, sweat prominent on his face. The abomination makes quick speed dashing through the mountain entrance. “Ubo, get off me!”", "“My king! You must not open that door!” The tortle flails helplessly from behind.", "“I will save my-” the words are cut short as the king collides with an invisible wall. The sudden barrier forces Wah’ter backwards as he crashes onto the ground. ", "“Stand down, Wah’ter.” Tim emerges from the shadows with waves of energy trickling from his fingertips. A dome has formed around Wah’ter and Ubo, trapping them in a wall of force.", "“Fucking wizards,” Wah’ter snarls. “Why are you stopping me?”", "“Because if you open that door and we are all dead,” says Dig who arrives at the scene.", "“That’s...” Wah’ter knows it’s the truth but his heart cannot accept this. ", "Now another voice can be heard. A low menacing hum. A tone they’re all too familiar with. “What sort of heroes run away and hide with their tails tucked between their legs?” Yoshimitsu taunts.", "“The kind that live to get even stronger,” Dig retorts.", "All of a sudden, the triton roars and shoots up to his feet with the tortle still hanging precariously from him. He reaches for his consecrated trident and thrusts with all his might into the magical veil. The House of Nekadh’s power manages to partially pierce Tim’s exceptional magic just enough so that a head can peek through. Wah’ter, in desperation, attempts to squeeze himself through this gap.", "“My lord!” Ubo yells. “It’s impossible!” ", "Dig appears in front of the force wall’s opening and glowers at his companion. “Don’t even think about it.”", "Defiant, the triton focuses as he manipulates his own body’s cells. To everyone’s awe, a double of Wah’ter forms behind Dig and rushes towards the Obsidian Gate. ", "Tim reaches out to the clone. “Someone stop him from-”", "“It’s fine,” Dig says. “He can’t open the door without the box.”", "“I know.” The Wah’ter still inside the dome stares into the dragonborn’s eyes. ", "Howls of pain and desperation now catch all of their attentions. The triton double is slamming its fists against the Obsidian Gates and clawing furiously at the metal plating in a futile struggle. ", "“I don’t care,” Wah’ter mutters.", "Yoshimitsu continues. “What is that box that you are carrying?” ", "Ro’nok frowns. Is that fear in the Oni’s tone?", "The disdain is clear. “It reeks of elder magic and the gods.” ", "“Interesting...” Tim makes a mental note of this. “So Yoshimitsu doesn’t know what the box is either.”", "“You’re not getting the box.” Dig laughs. “Let me guess. You're going to propose a trade.”", "“Keep your secrets, boy. I only know it threatens my lord and so I must secure it at no matter the cost. But there need be no further bloodshed today. You are correct. I propose an honest trade.”", "The sorcerer listens closely. “I have a feeling I already know where this is going.”", "“Open the door and I will trade you the life of the woman one of your friends loves so dearly for the box of which I’m sure you will not miss.”", "“No!” You hear Wolyn slam the door with her hand. “Listen to me! Leave me and get yourselves to the Badlands! I heard Yoshimitsu talking, they said that the rift is-“", "“Silence, triton whore!” There is a resounding crack as presumably, Yoshimitsu slaps Wolyn across the cheek. The faint sound of loose teeth dashing against stone sends Wah’ter into a fit. “Make your choice or make your peace.”", "Auron has smoke spouting out the side of his nostrils and mouth. His eyes burn with anger and he sneers at the door. ", "The party argues for a while but it is becomes clear very quickly that there isn’t much of a discussion to be had. Even Wah’ter, the one most willing to save his sister, knows the harsh reality that she is doomed.", "“Time is up. Answer me.”", "“Not happening, Yoshimitsu.” Dig says coolly.", "“I gave you your chance. Now this tomb shall become your grave. Any last words for your darling sister, triton king?”", "Wah’ter remains silent in his magical confinement. He sobs quietly as Lord Commander Ubo consoles him as best as he can. The tortle is thinking of what foods and treats he can make for his king to cheer him up.", "Wolyn’s gentle voice reaches their ears. “Wah’ter… live long. I lo-” Her voice is cut short as the sound of blood curdling in her throat resounds loudly in the mountain. ", "The party collectively freeze. ", "“Oh, shit.” Ubo approaches the triton calmly.", "But Wah’ter lies still. The primordial rage is churning inside of him like a brewing storm, but he does not unleash it. He collapses into the unloving arms of despair. .“Oh my apologies. I didn’t realise she was still going. Well, see you in the Badlands then.” Yoshimitsu’s raspy laugh is the last thing the party hear before the demon disappears.", "-The party didn’t really know how to deal with Wah’ter. There wasn’t really much that they could say to him. After all, out of everyone here, Wah’ter was the one who lived through the most trauma. How many had died because of him? How many had he personally put down himself? Wah’ter collapsed and allowed himself to be carried by Lord Commander Ubo. Would he ever recover from this fully? Could he? Imagine being the poor bastard in real life, what a shit time", "-Arthalas came up to offer his condolences and Varrus, although usually quite buddy-buddy with Wah’ter, was at a loss for words. He offered the triton king his drink. The entire party moved on with Ubo dragging Wah’ter on his shell and moving forward into the tunnels ahead.", "The Bullet Train", "With nowhere else to go, the only course of action left is to venture deeper into the depths of the Urulu Mountain. Rock and dirt turns into polished stone and the surroundings better resemble civilisation. The first sign of such is in the peculiar man-made contraption, sitting on a worn down path which narrows down into an absurdly long dug out tunnel. It resembles a carriage but Bickman and the Boys can’t imagine that it will go very far on account of there being no horses to pull it. Only two long rows of rounded steel beams run underneath this metal box.", "Dig Bickman cautiously moves forward with his claws at the ready. He taps the side of the construct. “Easy there, girl.”", "Tim raises an eyebrow. “Really?”", "The sorcerer shrugs. “I rolled for animal handling.”", "Arthalas takes Bickman’s cue and draws his bow to take aim. “What is this creature? Is it friendly?”", "With a hearty chuckle, Varrus eases the elf’s bow down. “None of that now, laddie, this thing won’t be attackin’ any time soon. I dare a guess that none of you have ever seen one of these before.”", "Tim smirks. “I can hazard a guess that this is another,” he sighs, “machine.”", "“Indeed- though not altogether different from the Dragonfly of yours. It’s a relic from the old days when the ancient elves were still alive.”", "Arthalas frowns. “My people used to create such things? I find it hard to believe.”", "“Ah well you better believe it lad. This and a lot more.”", "“So what does it do, exactly?” Dig asks.", "“Like your dragonfly, transport. Actually used to be that there were several of these things which took us between the many dwarven Thaigs.”", "“Thaigs?” Gizzard snorts as he arrives at the platform alongside the rest of the group.", "“The dwarven term for our cities,” Varrus explains. “But that’s history now. This is the last remant of the old days. Oh well. Should take us all the way to Urulu in less than half an hour, at least.”", "Tim, although wary of machinery at best, is still respectful of a relic from the old times. “Very well. How does it work then? Can we get it running?”", "“Naturally! Why you...” Varrus pauses as he takes a slow glance towards the machine itself. “That’s not quite right. Usually guards’d be linin’ up from there to my arse. Where’s the train conductor? Where’s the driver?” The Urulu Outrider captain draws his thunder cannon and proceeds cautiously towards the train. “I have a bad feeling in me gut, Boys. Something is a wee bit off.”", "-Dig investigated the front of the train while Arthalas took a look at the back. The dragonborn would make his way onto the other side as he followed a trail of blood which led to the side door. There were some body parts lying about on the ground inside black plate mail. Varrus explained to Dig that the dwarven guard would be pdressed in Malchionite, or black steel in Common.", "-Tim also approached and noted that the side entrance to the second carriage (this train was comprised of three cars), was webbed shut. Similarly on Dig’s side, the side door looked to be covered in this sticky, gooey web. Ubo arrived a bit later with Wah’ter still on his back and assisted as best as he could. Together, all three mages utilised fire magic to burn away the seals. ", "-Dig stepped inside first and immediately was attacked. Or at least, he thought he was. Instead, the body of a dead dwarf fell into his arms. Dig checked to see if the dwarf was still breathing but quickly realised that this guard was long dead since the entire lower half of him was missing. The dragonborn put aside the corpse and stepped inside. Tim did the same on the other end with the rest of the group following closely behind.", "-It was a massacre inside. A parade of body parts, blood and web. There were even several cocoons that were man-sized. Obviously, some sort of arachnid or spider-like creatures were roaming about. This put the party on full alert as they investigated the second carriage of this train. ", "Varrus looks wearily over the fallen dwarves. “What in Moradin’s name happened here?” ", "Arthalas wipes his finger through a web in the corner of the carriage. “Spiders, one would presume. But unless I’m mistaken, there are no spiders that can rip a man in two.”", "“Especially not when they’re wearin’ malchionite plate. This is black steel, one of the finest dwarven metals.”", "Arthalas turns his gaze towards the heroes. “What do you Boys think?”", "“I’m afraid I don’t quite know.” Tim shakes his head. “I don’t sense any magical residue. These creatures may be simple beasts.”", "Ro’nok kneels and utters some prayers to the fallen, which Varrus is grateful for.The dwarf points to the door at the end of the carriage where more blood marks and webbing seems to be present. “Our answer’s in there. Something behind the door.”", "The party look at each other in unison. Who was going to draw the short stick this time?", "“I am... looking after my king.” Ubo coughs and looks away.", "Gizzard has his arms crossed over his chest. “Web. No eat.”", "Tim and Dig roll their eyes. The two move over to the door and ready their fire spells to unleash havoc on the mass of webs. Meanwhile, Arthalas and Varrus both draw their weapons and aim it steadily at the entrance, ready for whatever may jump out at them.When the webs are incinerated, steam hisses as hydraulics work to part the sliding door. ", "They expect a roar, a howl or something to leap out at them but instead, the heroes hear a soft whimpering voice from within the driver’s cabin. “Please just end it, I begs ya…” ", "Ubo can make out a small form crumpled on the ground in the driver cabin. “I’ll go.” ", "“I will come too, then,” says Wah’ter, defeated.", "Inside is an old dwarven man with a massive slash wound on his stomach. His guts are falling out and he’s trying to keep them inside but finding it hard to get a firm grip on account of his failing strength. ", "“You’re- you’re not them?”", "“One of who?” Wah’ter questions.", "“Them things with the pincers and claws. They attacked us, you know?”", "“All we see are dead dwarves. What do you know?” Ubo taps impatiently on his arm.", "“I’m just a passenger, I ran into the driver cabin and locked myself in but not before…” he looks at his open wound and whimpers. “I didn’t get a good look at them things, we was too scared. But I saw they gots huge claws and then another with these pincers for mouths. Oh gods, is this how I go? This is all the humans fault, I’m telling you.”", "“Yeah, I agree.” Wah’ter nods. “The humans are always going about messing things up.”", "From outside the cabin, Tim moans, “Oh come on, man.”", "The colour is fading quickly from him. “We was escorting a human when all of a sudden these things attacked us. He probably summoned these monsters, the bastard. Should have never let him in.” He coughs and blood comes out. ", "“Where is this man?” Ubo presses.", "With considerable strain, the dying man points towards the back cabin where the door is once more sealed with web. Then, “Please kill me. It hurts.”", "Wah'ter nods and draws his trident.", "-After dealing with the dwarf, they investigated the third carriage where they would stumble upon even more dead dwarves. This time, however, they could hear someone struggling from underneath one of the mounds. Whoever or whatever was underneath the pile of corpses cried out for assistance. Seeing a human hand, Dig carried the corpses away and soon, they found themselves face to face with...", "All Aboard", "-Black Metal Tarkus. He looked unremarkable and to be honest, not all that intimidating in physical appearance. The man had some skull insignia on him and messy black hair, bloodshot eyes and a crooked smile. But there was a certain charm in the way this man presented himself. ", "-Anyway, the train started moving thanks to Varrus explaining its mechanisms. Ubo began shovelling in Dara into the furnace as Auron heated it up with his flame breath. The combustion of the Dara powered the train and very quickly the train shot off deeper into the mountain. ", "-It was quite a beautiful sight, this mountain hidden away from the advancement of time like on the surface. This solitary train was riding along on a spacious, desolate track in the silence of the mountain. It was surreal. The train was running on tracks that were held up by strong, rigid beams over running lava. The mountain itself looked like it had been carved out and outside, they could see the ruins of ancient cities and other sites that would have never been seen by outsiders before. Tim was particularly impressed and found himself taken aback. This was the Old World and it was humbling to be witness to this special piece of history", "-As the train passed underneath a lava waterfall (is there even a term for this?), the party continued to speak with Black Metal Tarkus. Wah’ter was particularly interested in this human and asked him many questions about his upbringing, where he was from, the usual. It didn’t take long for Wah’ter to start talking about the city of Lantanis to this man. The amount of shit that came out of Wah’ter’s mouth was not surprising to anyone else in the group, who had heard his tales and lectures over a hundred times", "-Black Metal Tarkus revealed very little save for that he was in an underground scene in the King’s Forest. He was a bard and dabbled in a very particular brand of music which wasn’t too popular with the contemporary folk. The bard carried with him three instruments which the party had not seen before. The bard was surprised at seeing the golden dragon, Auron, and promptly introduced himself. The human was amazed that a dragon was here in the first place, and even more amazed when he realised the extent of this dragon’s sentience and intelligence. The bard found himself respecting Auron from the get-go. ", "-When the party pressed the human for information about the train and why he was down here, the bard blamed it on poor management and politics. Apparently he had been wrongfully arrested on false charges by the Jarl of West Australis and that instead of facing his punishment, he decided that he would seek his own justice. By that, he ran off before the sentencing could be passed. This would lead him into the mountain of Urulu where he was about to board the train and seek amnesty with the dwarves. This clearly didn’t turn out for the better as they were then attacked by monsters. Black Metal wasn’t entirely sure what had attacked them either because it had been dark and the attack so sudden there wasn’t time to properly prepare. ", "-The party were still a little weary and unsure of what to make of this man. Dig decided that because their destination was the same, at least for the time being, they could travel together. If they were to part ways at Urulu, so be it. But for now they would see that whatever “justice” was intended for Black Metal would ultimately be served.", "-Black Metal Tarkus continued to interact with the rest of the party members to get to know them all a bit better (good RP Doug). ", "Ettercaps and Umber Hulks", "Tim rests himself against the glass window and tries to get what sleep he can. ", "Thankfully, all the time spent aboard the Dragonfly has ensured that none of the party will experience motion sickness, even despite the incredible speed this train is travelling at. They each fondly recall the times they’ve shared together as a party and prepare to rest for a while until all of a sudden, a deafening screech assaults their senses. The tram violently lurches forward and its metallic carapace slams against something in the dark. The abrupt change in force causes the tram to groan and shriek, forcing Arthalas off his feet as he collides into the side door, hard. ", "Only Tim fails to keep his footing and he collapses onto the floor. “Can we ever get a break for gods’ sakes.”", "Outside, an eerie clicking noise gets louder and louder. The party does not perceive this.", "The door to the driver’s cabin slams open and Varrus steps out, alarmed. “Lads, we have a wee problem!”", "Dig rubs his temples. “What is it now?”", "“I… I cannae believe it myself but the trams stuck on a web. A darned big one.”", "-Wah’ter and Tim are the ones who decide to go out and investigate outside. They stepped onto the tracks to find that the train was essentially caught in a network of webs which had latched them onto the tracks and beams. Tim quickly got to work, readying his fire spells and Wah’ter watching for any surprises.", "-This was when the skittering intensified and Auron’s voice echoed in their minds to “LOOK UP!”", "-Hundreds of burrows in the roof and creatures leapt out onto them and this began the encounter. The encounter was not a challenging one for them but they knew that this wasn’t going to be a true battle, rather another escape. Every second longer they spent than necessary here, was more time for the creatures attacking them to arrive.", "-Ettercaps and Umberhulks crawled into the train, others fell on top of the tracks and attacked Tim and Wah’ter. The most key events of the battle included:", "Wah’ter bodyguarding Tim and taking all of the claws and bites for the wizard. Wah’ter would fall prey to the mesmerising psychic gaze of a umber hulk, but saved by Tim when a fireball incinerated the overgrown beetle. Tim would spend the majority of the battle burning away at the webs, slowly", "Ubo used his magical abilities to generate a gust of wind to blow away the creatures that were falling out of the roof. This bought the heroes plenty of time as they faced the attackers. Eventually Ubo would do even better and use his gust of wind to blow away at all the webs keeping the train locked down (which had by this point been weakened by the fire spells and whatnot)", "Black Metal Tarkus polymorphed himself into a giant spider and used his new ‘web-aptitude’ to completely dominate the creatures outside. He assisted both Tim and Wah’ter with the webs and also killed plenty of enemies on the way. On one occasion however, he cast an eldritch bolt. This sickly green bolt of energy was something that the party would remember. How did a bard know such a spell?", "Dig used his lightning prowess to cast chain lightnings and shocking touches to completely lock down the inside of the train. The ettercaps and umberhulks stood very littele chance against the lightning dragon’s storm magic.", "Gizzard and Ro’nok spent most of their time buying more time for the party as several of the creatures started wailing upon them. Both of these hammer wielding brothers were rendered helpless for the majority of the encounter as they found themselves mesmerised by the Umber Hulks’ gazes.", "Arthalas shot a flurry of arrows which killed a few foes. Varrus was trying to keep the train functioning while also fighting in the driver’s cabin against an ettercap. Using a thunder cannon in close quarters was difficult but once the dwarf jammed his gun into the ettercap’s mouth and blew its brains out, the train was once again functional", "The webbing was all dealt with and the train started moving again. Ubo began furiously shovelling more Dara in while Wah’ter decided to do something incredibly daring. He grabbed Tim in one arm and cast a powerful gust of wind which sent the train hurtling forward at close to 120km/h. Black Metal was still in his giant spider form and barely managed to latch himself onto the fast moving train before skittering back inside.", "The Chwidencha", "-A demonic spider creature then dropped down from the roof and started chasing them too. Both Wah’ter and Gizzard leapt onto the creature (which was actually just a mass of spider legs, real nightmare fuel) and started stabbing, slashing and pounding away.", "-This was when the party realised the extent of their issues. Not only were they now being chased by this nightmarish beast, but in front of them was a chasm 300 metres across. On the other side of the chasm they could now see the walls and lights of Urulu itself. If they wanted any chance of survival, they would have to come up with a plan quick. Thankfully, both Tim and Black Metal had some tricks of their own", "-Wah’ter bought everyone time by using his own psychic gaze at the creature. Even something as monstrous as the Chwidencha was helpless when it looked upon the terrifying visage of the abomination. The Chwidencha, which was following the train from the nearby cliff, was frozen in shock for the time being. Note however, that the train had continued to move forward and so this meant Gizzard was stuck on this demonic spider while watching his friends effectively abandon him. In truth, the party was confident that Gizzard would find a way... somehow", "-The Chwidencha eventually got its senses together again and began to chase after the train again. Its freakish speed allowed it to catch up and it tried desperately to hook one of its legs onto the fuselage. Dig had a moment of inspiration and absolutely destroyed the creature by reversing gravity itself. The Chwidencha fell upwards and impaled itself against a stalactite. Wah’ter and Gizzard were also caught in the reversal field too but they both managed to get out of it. Wah’ter used his dragoon training to propel himself back onto the train while Gizzard was rescued by Black Metal, who had created a spectral griffin using magic", "-I should mention that Wah’ter was pissed off at Ubo because Ubo refused to cast disintegrate on the Chwidencha. In later years, this would cause Ubo to fall down in ranking to the party’s worst mage LOL", "-The only problem now was finding a way to cross the 300 metre chasm. This was when Tim quickly unveiled his plan to the rest of the party. He was going to animate the tracks themselves. This was incredibly crazy of course. First off, there was no guarantee that the tracks themselves would even be able to support the train in mid-air. Secondly, the abundance of Dara and dimeritium in the mountain was also inhibiting to Tim’s magic so his own spell could fail to activate. There was little time left to decide. The rest of the party also came up with their own fallbacks and solutions. The final decision turned out to be:", "Ubo contemplated whether he could use his waterwalking ability to save hismelf if he was to fall on lava. It would probably burn the skin of his feet but he assured himself that he would be able to climb back up onto the cliff. Black Metal told him that the climb back up to the city would be a ridiculous task. Ubo shrugged. If he had to, he could use his fury ability to at least stay afloat until help arrived", "Dig stayed near Auron and made sure that if the plan went south, he’d be able to save people. Dig made the lives of Ro’nok and Gizzard his responsibility also. He would polymorph the two of them into flying creatures and ride Auron. Dig tried to convince Tim to animate one of the colossal dwarven statues to simply carry the train across but the wizard argued that they were too far away for him to reach", "Black Metal Tarkus flew up on the griffin and waited on standby in case the party needed help. However, he was perfectly safe from up here", "Wah’ter looked after the welfare of Varrus and Arthalas. He had grown quite close to the two of them recently and he would ensure that they both survive through this ordeal. The three hundred metre gap wouldn’t be a problem for him. Perhaps if this was underwater it would be- but with only gravity stopping him this would be a cakewalk.", "Ubo was desperately shovelling the dara out from the furnace and Varrus was slamming on the brakes but it was clear that they still had too much speed. Ubo cast disintegrate on the tracks behind them, which made sparks and debris fly all over the place chaotically. Tim used the remaining piece of track (underneath and in front) of the train to cast his animation on. The track became a flying carpet of sorts as the train was now airborne on top of tracks which propelled the entire party over the chasm. Everyone inside the train screamed as they cleared one hundred, then two hundred, then two hundred and fifty metres.", "But the last fifty metres, the train began to plummet. Dig and Ubo combined their magic together to create a wall of stone which the train crashed upon. The train and tracks landed hard against the stone and came to a skidding halt in front of the stunned dwarves outside the city gates of Urulu. ", "Sparks everywhere, a train toppled over, a dead demonic spider, and a circus of freaks. All in all, another successful day", "TO BE CONTINUED"]
